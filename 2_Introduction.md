# Introduction

### Why a playbook?
Agile is the de-facto way of delivering software today. Compared to "waterfall" development, agile projects are far more likely to deliver on time, on budget, and having met the customer's need. Despite this broad adoption Industry standards remain elusive due the nature of agility
The purpose of this playbook is to educate new adopters of the agile mindset by curating many good practices that we’ve found to work for teams at Booz Allen. As we offer our perspective on implementing agile in your context, we present many "plays" -- use cases of agile practices that may work for you which together can help weave an overall approach for tighter delivery and more satisfied customers.

### Agile is a mindset
We view agile as a mindset – defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through countless practices - and actively encourage industry to embrace this definition.  Indeed, agile should not simply equate to delivering software in "Sprints" or a handful of "best practices" you can read in a book – but rather represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven delivery, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. Products and systems built using agile methods are shown to be delivered at a faster pace, lower cost, higher quality, and a greater level of customer satisfaction. Agile techniques cannot magically eliminate challenges intrinsic to high-discovery software development. But, by focusing on continuous delivery of incremental value and shorter feedback cycles, they do expose these challenges as early as possible, while there is still time to correct for them. As agile practitioners, we embrace the innate mutability of software and harness that flexibility for the benefit of our customers and users. 

We've come to this perspective as software practitioners, living in the trenches and delivering software on teams using increasingly modern methods, and in support of dozens of customers across the US Government and international commercial market.  The following few sections provide further elaboration on this perspective.


### On delivery and value
We are explicitly acknowledging the relationship between Delivery and Value, and we use terms like Delivery Team and Value Team to help us understand what each others' focus may be:  but it's crucial to consider that, together, we are still one team, with one goal, and we seek a common path to reach that goal.  In the delivery and value sections, we will take a look at plays that will help deliver quality software to users in the shortest intervals possible.

### On teams
A team is the core of any agile organization. In a project of two people or two-hundred -- the work happens in teams. And at the core of teams are humans. Just as we seek to build products that delight the humans who use them, we seek to be happier, more productive humans at work, later in the playbook we will address specific areas to support the team and scale.

### On craftsmanship
Agile software engineering is still software engineering. Ron Jeffries tells us, "The software we build has to be robust enough to support the business need. It needs to be sufficiently free of defects to be usable and desirable. It needs to be well structured enough to allow us to sustain its development as long as required.

Robust, reliable, well designed. These are not things that we just automatically get by having a Product Owner and a Scrum Master. Much less are these things we get by having really good Portfolio Vision and an Agile Release Train... If we do not build it well, all our teamwork, communication, retrospectives, business focus and WIP limitation are for nothing."

Delivering great systems requires a dedication to the craft and an eye toward excellence. Technical agility and strength is necessary for teams to be truly agile, the we will explore the many facets of craftsmanship.

### On measurement
Self organizaed teams still need ways to detetmine estimate their work to determine how much can be delivered when.  In addtion, measuring progress and performance helps the team improve overall.  Agile measurement is a topic that impacts the enire team and no longer is reservred for managers.  We will take a look at som specific mearsurments and discuss their meaning.

### On Adaptation
The purpose of measurement is to improve and adjust based on findings.  Adpatation is key to improving team outcomes and adjusting as the environment and team changes.  We will look at a couple ways to regularly examine and find ways to improve the team and product.

### On management
 In a system with self organizing teams, where is the room for a manager?  What does agile management versus leadership look like and how does this affect everyone on the team?  We will take a look at how the manager leads in a new paradigm.
