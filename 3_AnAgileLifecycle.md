# An Agile Lifecycle

In this section, we introduce a simple "Agile Lifecycle" to help provide some context for the plays described in this document.
Our experience has taught us that nearly all (good) projects
-- regardless of method, framework, or practices -- 
tend to follow along this general path.

While depicted in sequence, 
it is important to understand that this is for simplicity and discussion only.
Projects generally start-up in this way, 
but they will likely execute these stages as needed
-- and often in parallel -- throughout the life of the project.

#### Concept & Alignment

Before we can get to work, we must first understand who we are and what we're trying to build -- at least in a broad sense.

In the **Concept & Alignment** stage, 
the team begins to build relationships with their stakeholders and users.
Together, they will build a shared understanding of 
the project vision, goals, values, and expectations.
They may employ Chartering Meetings to build product roadmaps and user personas, and capture strategic themes.

The team should also establish working agreements 
-- these identify how they will communicate, resolve conflict, and have fun, among other things --
and technical expectations, such as coding standards and their definitions of done.

And, this all should take place _in a matter of days_.
We want to get the team delivering as quickly as possible -- that is where the learning truly occurs and value is delivered.

#### Initiate & Prepare

Once the team, stakeholders, and users are aligned on the project vision and working arrangements, they should do _just enough planning_ to get the team delivering.

The **Initiate & Prepare** stage is where the team builds and estimates an initial backlog.
They put some thought into architecture; 
they might sketch out a few sprints-worth of work -- three months or so. 
We want to pay attention to the idea that we understand 
things we need to do soon, but we are fuzzy on things that are going to done more than a month from now. We don't want to spend too much time on things
that are likely to change anyway.

Many teams call this period Sprint 0; and in addition to light planning, we want to put some time upfront 
into infrastructure and tooling; let's make sure we can get from a commit to a build quickly.
Let's smooth our deployment process so it's not a pain when time is tight.


#### Deliver

This is where the rubber meets the road, so to speak.

Leveraging one of the agile delivery frameworks,
the team works to transform the needs of their users into valuable, tested, potentially shippable software.

We build; we test; we keep designing; we keep talking to users. We do this as much as we need to, until we are done.
