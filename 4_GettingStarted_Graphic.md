# Getting started - Your first month (or so)
So you've never been an agile team before. How to get started?

This quick list gives a frame for getting started, using concepts you'll find more detail about in other areas of this playbook.

Keep in mind, it's not practical to totally change everything about how you work overnight. You should start somewhere, try things, 
talk about it, and improve as you go.

## Sprint 0 — Two weeks to a month

This period does not have to be strictly timeboxed; you want to get things in place so that you're ready to begin delivery as an agile team. 
Don't linger though -- we want to be delivering!

### Likely activities 

* Identify the users and stakeholders
* Get charge authorizations, get user accounts, and access to IT systems and buildings
* Have a team chartering session; discuss expectations; define “Done” for the project, for a sprint, and for a work item
* Start talking about an overall architecture approach
* Identify some likely technologies; perform analysis of alternatives
* Prepare the team space – make sure the physical space is conducive to collaboration and productivity; set up information radiators
* Get your development environment set up; does anyone need training on version control or a tool?
* Set up your build infrastructure; get a basic build of an empty project running on a continuous integration server
* Get a few user stories into the backlog
* Communicate the output of Sprint 0 to the teams and stakeholders

## Sprint 1 — Two weeks

### Likely activities 

* Hold daily standups
* Be sure the backlog is estimated
* Work with the users, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and team members to establish a Sprint backlog
* Focus on identifying end-to-end functionality that can offer value, end-to-end, when delivered
* Write code; test; get user stories “Done”
* Hold a demo -- at this stage, you may just have some wireframes and/or screen mockups -- to obtain client feedback
* Hold a retrospective and make changes to improve

## Sprint 2 — Two weeks

### Likely activities 

* Hold daily standups
* Estimate new backlog items
* Hold Sprint planning to establish the Sprint backlog
* Write code; test; get user stories “Done”
* Hold a demo; obtain client feedback
* Measure your velocity; how do you feel about the team’s productivity?
* Hold a retrospective; is there anything to improve?

## Sprint 3 and beyond

### Likely activities 
* Keep going – inspect and adapt!
