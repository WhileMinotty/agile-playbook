##Organizational agility or agile at scale

Agile at scale is more than simply applying agile practices on multiple teams. Agile at scale requires multiple levels of coordination to ensure all the teams are moving in the same direction within the enterprise. Other aspects such as culture and funding must be considered as well. Implementing agile in an organization cannot be top down or grass roots alone. A successful implementation must include both. It’s for this reason we must address applying agile practices at the team level in addition, we must train the managers and executives as well.

### Play - Train management to be agile
To migrate an entire organization to a new way of thinking and acting, all members of the organization need two way communication, to help everyone understand what it means to the organization and for his/her particular role.  This is most crucial for management at all levels.  Through educating the management team in the changing mindset and overall vision for the organization, the team can work through the change management together with a unified approach.  This assists with organizational change, as well as ensuring the teams are being provided the resources and space they need to norm.

### Play - Decentralize decision making
The key to remaining agile with more than one team, is allowing decisions that are made frequently or do not have widespread impact, be made at the team level.  Large organizations that require all decision to be made by an organization's body that meets to make decisions for all parts of the organization often cause delay.  The decision delay can be as long as it would take to execute the decision, causing waste in the form of time for an organization.  Localized decision making also contribute to team ownership, which is essential to embodying the agile principles.  Centralized decision making still has a place in large organizations, however.  When deciding to centralize a decision examine if the decision is; infrequent, impacts the entire organization, and has a time constraint.  This will help guide whether it would benefit from decentralization.

###Managing backlogs
Scaling agile development teams to program or portfolio levels mean managing competing needs through alignment of vision and synchronization of sprints and delivery with dependence upon each other.  Just as a team has a backlog that is regularly prioritized, and elaborated, a  program or portfolio must also have a backlog that is groomed to allow for prioritization of work. The backlog at this level needs to have flexibility to align with near term organizational priorities and enough elaboration to assign the appropriate level of resources.  A Planning Roadmap is a good tool to plan for the near term defined as the current fiscal quarter, with planning up to rolling year in advance.  Less detail in the Roadmap is needed as it progresses to the future, as the longer term needs will continue to be prioritized and elaborated on a regular basis.

### Play - Plan for uncertainty in a large organizations
How do you plan for something unplanned?  As discussed earlier, decentralizing decision authority is one technique to enable flow and eliminate waiting for a centralized authority.  Other ways are to plan only as long term as required. Put energy into only the immediate or funded activities.  Planning beyond this, should have less effort expended as it will allow to pivot, should organizational context change. The planning horizons vary among organizations, but often fiscal schedules or contracts guide the overall roadmap.  Agile is a mindset, even those at the highest level of the organization need to remember that.

## Play - Implement SAFe when relevant

### SAFe at a high level
Just as the Agile Manifesto is founded in principles and values the foundation of SAFe includes
values, principles, lean-agile leaders, and a commitment to quality. At the highest level of abstraction
SAFe includes multiple levels that combine to form the SAFe Framework. The Portfolio level has the
fiduciary responsibility and utilizes Kanban practices to move work through their system. The Kanban
System makes the strategic business initiatives visible and brings a structured analysis process driven
by economics. Strategic initiatives are realized through the elaboration and prioritization of Epics.
Once the Epic has been analyzed, vetted, and relatively sized using story points within the Portfolio
Kanaban it goes into the Portfolio backlog. (could add roles at this level: Epic Owner, Enterprise
Architect)

At the levels below the Portfolio lives the virtual organization called an Agile Release Train (ART). This
organization is a long lived team of teams comprised of the Program and Team levels. It’s at this level
we break down the Portfolio Epics to Features and eventually stories. The ART receives it’s operating
budget from the Portfolio and delivers Features based on the capacity of the ART. All teams work in 2
week increments as part of the ART. This synchronization of team cadence allows for planning,
integration, and delivery. These Agile teams still conduct their individual Agile ceremonies each
increment but the ART must come together at key times as a larger group. (could add roles at this
ART level: RTE, Product Management, Business Owners, Release Management, DevOps, Systems
Team, UX, System Architect)

The entire ART comes together to plan what’s known as a Program Increment (PI) or a group of three
to five 2-week increments. Every PI the business stakeholders deliver the top priority Features,
business context, business strategy, and vision. The ART revisits the architecture, non-functional
requirements, and engineering practices to ensure all teams understand the technical content and
bounds they are expected to work within for the PI. It’s also during this time the teams break Features
into User Stories and commit to delivery by the end of the PI. By the end of planning each team will
have identified and addressed any dependencies and risks, elaborated and sized User Stories,
planned out each 2-week increment, team objectives identified for the PI and received a business
value from business stakeholders for each, and presented the plan to the entire ART and
stakeholders. Before planning ends a confidence vote is conducted to ensure each team and all
stakeholders are confident in their ability to deliver.

Each week of the PI the Product Owners from each team will meet to discuss progress and
impediments and each Scrum Master or representative from the team will do the same. In addition,
the Product Owners and Scrum Masters may come together weekly for an ART synch to discuss
progress and impediments as a group. This allows the team to continue to make progress
uninterrupted while impediments are actively eliminated.

At the end of a PI the ART comes together to demo the fully integrated solutions. An Inspect & Adapt
workshop is conducted afterward to improve the ART in the same way a Retrospective enables
improvement at the team level. The Inspect & Adapt workshop utilizes root cause analysis to identify
problems at the ART level and action items resulting are entered into the improvement backlog for
problems at the ART level and action items resulting are entered into the improvement backlog for
implementation in the next PI.

**Even the O&M Kanban team will participate in ART level ceremonies. Might consider them to be
Scrumban. Recommend they adopt the Retrospective on their team. Regardless of Agile practices
adopted at the team level (Scrum, Kanban, XP, Scrumban) they will need to participate in ART
cadence and synchronization) O&M team should even be at PI planning in order to ensure they aren’t
a dependency or risk for other teams and adjust accordingly. Also, they could have valuable input for
other teams from their perspective of having to O&M.

####Program Kick-off:
Train Everyone - BAH has in-house experts to train and certify: Agile Fundamentals, Product Owner,
and all SAFe courses (except SPC)


BAH also has 20+ Agile Coaches. Perform an Agile Readiness Evaluation in order to prioritize and
tackle potential Agile impediments (formulate a plan of action based on results)
Prioritization:

Begin at the Portfolio - prioritize Epics and align to strategic themes (LOB?) of the business
Strategic Themes = LOB?


Items listed under LOB = Epics? (Can we get Epics Value Statement and Lightweight Business
Case?)


Program backlog - WSJF prioritization of Features (benefit of prioritization at this level is the inclusion
of local context and constraints). The benefit of WSJF is the elimination of competing opinions or
champions of singular items (i.e. loudest voice gets priority).


Team backlog - Product owner (from the business) prioritizes the team backlog per increment to
ensure local optimization and alignment to business needs


####Transitions:
O&M teams, while operating using Scrumban (Scrum and Kanban) Agile practices, will participate in
ART level ceremonies such as PI planning, PI Demo, and Inspect & Adapt Workshop.
Benefits of participation in PI Planning: ensure they aren’t a dependency or risk for other teams and
adjust accordingly, valuable input to development teams form O&M team(s), ability to shift people as
necessary based on surge needs at PI boundaries based on plan, understanding of upcoming
applications that will need O&M and plan for learning those apps, ability to plan sunsets/retirements
based on development teams’ plans for the PI.
Benefits of participating in PI Demo: Seeing the new applications in action provides learning
opportunity and ability to ask deeper questions.
Benefits of participating in Inspect & Adapt Workshop: opportunity to have a voice and raise problems
as part of the ART, ability to be part of the solution as well in an effort to improve the ART.


####Teams:
ScrumXP teams - Sprint activities remain the same (2 week cadence, sprint planning, daily stand up,
demo/review, retrospective). PI activities include Scrum of Scrum (SM attend), PI planning, PI Demo,
Inspect & Adapt workshop. XP practices utilized by the teams include TDD, test automation, paired
programming where optimal (possibly paired with O&M for preparing O&M team member to take
ownership), continuous delivery (DevOps) etc TBD


O&M Scrumban teams - Utilize a Kanban board to optimize flow of work through the system, setting
and adjusting WIP limits, ability to expedite urgent work that can’t be planned for. Utilize Scrum
practice of retrospecting to enable continuous improvement of the team and daily stand up to ensure
team visibility into daily work and impediments. The O&M Scrumban teams will also participate in ART
level ceremonies/activities.


System Team - will integrate solutions across teams for the PI demo, enable Agile Architecture, assist
in automation for continuous delivery.
