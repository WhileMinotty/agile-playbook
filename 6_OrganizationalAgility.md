##Organizational agility or agile at scale:

Agile at scale is more than simply applying agile practices on multiple teams. Agile at scale requires multiple levels of coordination to ensure all the teams are moving in the same direction within the enterprise. Other aspects such as culture and funding must be considered as well. Implementing Agile in an organization cannot be top down or grass roots alone. A successful implementation must include both. Itâ€™s for this reason we must address applying agile practices at the team level in addition, we must train the managers and executives as well.

###Training management to be agile
To migrate an entire organization to a new way of thinking and acting, all members of the organization need two way communication, to help everyone undertand what it means to the organization and for his/her particular role.  This is most crucial for management at all levels.  Through educating the management team in the changing mindset and overall vision for the organization, the team can work through the change management together with a unified approach.  This assists with organizational change, as well as ensuring the teams are being provided the resources and space they need to norm.

###Decentralize decision making
The key to remaining agile with more than one team, is allowing decisions that are made frequently or do not have widespread impact, be made at the team level.  Large organizations that require all decision to be made by an organization's body that meets to make decisions for all parts of the organization often cause delay.  The decision delay can be as long as it would take to execute the decision, causing waste in the form of time for an organization.  Localized decision making also contribute to team ownership, which is essential to embodying the agile principles.  Centralized decision making still has a place in large organizations, however.  When deciding to centralize a decision examine if the decision is; infrequent, impacts the entire organization, and has a time contraint.  This will help guide whether it would benefit from decentralization.

###Managing backlogs
Scaling agile development teams to program or portfolio levels mean managing competing needs through alignment of vision and synchronization of sprints and delivery with dependance upon each other.  Just as a team has a backlog that is regularly prioritized, and elaborated, a  program or portfolio must also have a backlog that is groomed to allow for prioritization of work. The backlog at this level needs to have flexibility to align with near term organizational priorities and enough elaboration to assign the appropriate level of resources.  A Planning Roadmap is a good tool to plan for the near term defined as the current fiscal quarter, with planning up to rolling year in advance.  Less detail in the Roadmap is needed as it progresses to the future, as the longer term needs will continue to be prioritized and elaborated on a regular basis.
