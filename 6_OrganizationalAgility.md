# Organizational agility and agile at scale

Agile at scale is more than simply applying agile practices on multiple teams. Agile at scale requires multiple levels of coordination to ensure all the teams are moving in the same direction within the enterprise. Other aspects such as culture and funding must be considered as well. Implementing agile in an organization cannot be top down or grass roots alone. A successful adoption includes energy coming from both directions. So, we need to adopt agile practices at the team level, but also train and achieve buy-in with managers and executives as well.

There are some summary things we want you to know about scaling agility -

1. Agile is not its own goal.
    * Embrace agile for happier customers, higher morale, more innovation -- but not just because it's "agile"
2. It is hard.
    * There is no silver bullet, no singular unifying theory or framework that will guarantee stress-free success 
     with agile at scale. It will take trying, improving, and signficant energy and commitment from the organization.
3. Use agile to scale agile.
    * Build in constant experimentation and feedback; use a foundation of great agile teams; have empathic lean-agile leaders.
4. Training is essential.
    * Small organizations can accidentally run into great discoveries and organic ways of working. This is much less likely at scale.
    * Whether using a packaged delivery framework or your own creation, training and alignment is essential.
5. Process isn't everything.
    * Process is important, but it's not sufficient to execute agile at scale. 
    * Culture is as or more important. Be mindful that it's happening. Guide it. Treasure great culture.
6. SAFe is one approach, but there are others
    * For many, "scaled agile" is becoming synonymous with the Scaled Agile Framework, or SAFe; but there are other frameworks and 
     approaches for scaling agile that you should consider. Among them are LeSS, NEXUS, and MAXOS.
7. Start simply.
    * Little changes can have a big effect on a large organization.
    * Be mindful of existing culture and institutions. Changing everything overnight is unlikely to be successful.



### Play - Train management to be agile
To migrate an entire organization to a new way of thinking and acting, all members of the organization need two-way communication, to help everyone understand what it means to the organization and for his/her particular role.  This is most crucial for management at all levels.  Through educating the management team in the changing mindset and overall vision for the organization, the team can work through the change management together with a unified approach.  This assists with organizational change, as well as ensuring the teams are being provided the resources and space they need to norm.

### Play - Decentralize decision making
The key to remaining agile with more than one team, is allowing decisions that are made frequently or do not have widespread impact, be made at the team level.  Large organizations that require all decision to be made by an organization's body that meets to make decisions for all parts of the organization often cause delay.  The decision delay can be as long as it would take to execute the decision, causing waste in the form of time for an organization.  Localized decision making also contribute to team ownership, which is essential to embodying the agile principles.  Centralized decision making still has a place in large organizations, however.  When deciding to centralize a decision examine if the decision is; infrequent, impacts the entire organization, and has a time constraint.  This will help guide whether it would benefit from decentralization.

###Managing backlogs
Scaling agile development teams to program or portfolio levels mean managing competing needs through alignment of vision and synchronization of sprints and delivery with dependence upon each other.  Just as a team has a backlog that is regularly prioritized, and elaborated, a  program or portfolio must also have a backlog that is groomed to allow for prioritization of work. The backlog at this level needs to have flexibility to align with near term organizational priorities and enough elaboration to assign the appropriate level of resources.  A Planning Roadmap is a good tool to plan for the near term defined as the current fiscal quarter, with planning up to rolling year in advance.  Less detail in the Roadmap is needed as it progresses to the future, as the longer term needs will continue to be prioritized and elaborated on a regular basis.

### Play - Plan for uncertainty in a large organizations
How do you plan for something unplanned?  As discussed earlier, decentralizing decision authority is one technique to enable flow and eliminate waiting for a centralized authority.  Other ways are to plan only as long term as required. Put energy into only the immediate or funded activities.  Planning beyond this, should have less effort expended as it will allow to pivot, should organizational context change. The planning horizons vary among organizations, but often fiscal schedules or contracts guide the overall roadmap.  Agile is a mindset, even those at the highest level of the organization need to remember that.

## Play - Implement SAFe when relevant

### SAFe at a high level
The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is perhaps the most popular overall framework for scaling agile. It works well, typically,
when the organizaiton is over 50 people, and multiple teams are depending on each other to make the overall delivery work. 
We will explain some of the basics of SAFe here, but more information is freely available at scaledagileframework.com.

Just as the Agile Manifesto is founded in principles and values, the foundation of SAFe includes
values, principles, lean-agile leaders, and a commitment to quality. At the highest level of abstraction
SAFe includes multiple levels that combine to form the SAFe Framework. The Portfolio level has the
fiduciary responsibility and utilizes Kanban practices to move work through their system. The Kanban
System makes the strategic business initiatives visible and brings a structured analysis process driven
by economics. Strategic initiatives are realized through the elaboration and prioritization of Epics.
Once the Epic has been analyzed, vetted, and relatively sized using story points within the Portfolio
Kanaban it goes into the Portfolio backlog. 

At the levels below the Portfolio lives the virtual organization called an Agile Release Train (ART). This
organization is a long lived team of teams comprised of the Program and Team levels. It’s at this level
we break down the Portfolio Epics to Features and eventually stories. The ART receives it’s operating
budget from the Portfolio and delivers Features based on the capacity of the ART. All teams work in 2
week increments as part of the ART. This synchronization of team cadence allows for planning,
integration, and delivery. These Agile teams still conduct their individual Agile ceremonies each
increment but the ART must come together at key times as a larger group. 

The entire ART comes together to plan what’s known as a Program Increment (PI) or a group of three
to five 2-week increments. Every PI the business stakeholders deliver the top priority Features,
business context, business strategy, and vision. The ART revisits the architecture, non-functional
requirements, and engineering practices to ensure all teams understand the technical content and
bounds they are expected to work within for the PI. It’s also during this time the teams break Features
into User Stories and commit to delivery by the end of the PI. By the end of planning each team will
have identified and addressed any dependencies and risks, elaborated and sized User Stories,
planned out each 2-week increment, team objectives identified for the PI and received a business
value from business stakeholders for each, and presented the plan to the entire ART and
stakeholders. Before planning ends a confidence vote is conducted to ensure each team and all
stakeholders are confident in their ability to deliver.

Each week of the PI the Product Owners from each team will meet to discuss progress and
impediments and each Scrum Master or representative from the team will do the same. In addition,
the Product Owners and Scrum Masters may come together weekly for an ART synch to discuss
progress and impediments as a group. This allows the team to continue to make progress
uninterrupted while impediments are actively eliminated.

At the end of a PI the ART comes together to demo the fully integrated solutions. An Inspect & Adapt
workshop is conducted afterward to improve the ART in the same way a Retrospective enables
improvement at the team level. The Inspect & Adapt workshop utilizes root cause analysis to identify
problems at the ART level and action items resulting are entered into the improvement backlog for
problems at the ART level and action items resulting are entered into the improvement backlog for
implementation in the next PI.
