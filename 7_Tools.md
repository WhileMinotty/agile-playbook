# Tools

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

While agile teams value people and interactions over tools, there are still benefits to using
the right level of tools and using them well.

We describe here the main types of tools that agile teams use commonly. We want you to know that 
they exist, and consider if they will help your team.

Additionally, Booz Allen SD teams can request many free tools through SmartSuite NEXT at https://selfserviceportal.boozallencsn.com/ -- Tools included are marked with a * below.

### Knowledge Share/Collaboration
Knowledge sharing and collaboration appears in many forms from formalized training to informal chats to white boarding sessions to storage of documents to collaborative authoring and everything in between. Because the breadth of the tools available combined with their strengths and weaknesses, teams are encouraged to assess their goals prior to evaluating and selecting a tool.
* Tools to investigate
  * SharePoint
  * Atlassian Confluence*

### Asynchronous Code Reviews
Allows team members to review code and provide feedback on their own time versus simultaneously. The give-and-take of collaboration is not lost but occurs when it is convenient for the parties involved.

### Source Code Management/Configuration Management
Teams can simultaneously work on and maintain multiple versions of the same software or artifacts, deployed to different environments. Provides a logical manner for the team to organize and control revisions of software, documents, and other large collections of files.

### Test Automation
Automated tests help the team identify and resolve issues before users do when it is least expensive to fix. Prior to committing the code, it can be executing on a development team member's workstation can be quickly verified and validated with automated tests. This helps team members ensure their new code is compatible with the existing functionality. The tests can be committed with the code easing access and maintenance while encouraging reuse.

  * Ranorex
  * Tellurium
  * eValid
  * Unified Functional Testing
  * Selenium (free versions)

### Code Scanning
Ensures common coding errors are reduced and/or eliminated. Like automated testing, code-scanning tools assist in finding and fixing defects early in the software development process.
* Tools to investigate
  * Fortify
  * Coverity
  * SonarQube
  * PMD
  * Armorize CodeSecure
  * ZAP (free)

   
### Build Management / Continuous Integration
Ensures that all code is constantly merged from all team developers into a specific environment stream. Continuous integration increases the quality of the software by reducing the defect escape rate, and decreases maintenance and sustainment costs.
* Tools to investigate
   * Continuum
   * Cruise Control
   * Atlassian Bamboo*
   * Jenkins (free)*
   
### Persistent Group Chat
Provides the team access to an area for group messaging to encourage communication and collaboration. Group chat can improve the communication with remote team members and others across a geographically detached organization.

* Tools to investigate
   * WebEx
   * Zoom
   * Google Hangouts (free)
   
### Backlog Management
Provides Agile teams a consistent and repeatable tool to create and manage backlog items, whether they are User Stories, Defects, Tasks or Epics/Themes. Allows the Value team to prioritize the Product Backlog while the Delivery team can build the Sprint Backlog and Burndown thus focusing on the delivery of the customersâ€™ most important product features. Defect management activities are conducted in a manner that reflects traceability to requirements, design, and code. Facilitates the collection of metrics and the display of Information Radiators to provide real-time transparency into project progress.
