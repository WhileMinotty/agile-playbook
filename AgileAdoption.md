# Agile Adoption

> Agile transformation is a common topic for teams and organizations that want the benefits of an Agile mindset in their company.

To be able to move an organization to a common direction, the first step is to find a coalition of change agents in the organization with a variety of skills and influence within all levels of the organization. This coalition may have an Agile coach, as well as other change agents who bring multiple disciplines to a change of any size. Organizational design (OD) and organizational change management (OCM) are mature disciplines that have been refined by years of research and practical applications with developed techniques to ensure any change sticks. Let’s look at some techniques and an approach to Agile transformation that integrates the perspective of both OD and OCM. 

To start, the coalition of change agents develops a strategy to communicate and sustain process, culture, and workflow shifts, focusing on the people and structure of a major change. OCM is a person-centric approach, while OD looks at the formal and informal structures of an organization. Just as some Agile practices are borrowed from traditional facilitation techniques, we borrow practices and lessons from previous organizational changes. Large shifts in culture or vision for organizations are not unique to Agile transformations, both OD and OCM can point us to some proven strategies to help. 

In the following plays, we will be looking at how to blend OCM approaches to help a team or enterprise change their mindset. Additionally, we will look at how the OCM techniques can shepherd the organization throughout to help the success and sustainability of the transformation. Lastly, we will look at one example of an Agile coach and OCM professional providing that coalition of change agents and teaming up for success.

### Play: Plan to tackle some of the common challenges to agile organizations

For 1 to 100 teams to be successful working in an Agile way, they need the organization to support this new way of thinking. If an organization wants the benefits of Agile teams, they can no longer rely on the old hierarchy to gain new results. VersionOne’s 2017 “State of Agile Report” gives us insight into the trends of what is holding back Agile adoptions:

1. Company philosophy or culture at odds with core Agile values
2. Lack of management support
3. General organizational resistance to change
4. Lack of business/customer/product owner
5. Insufficient training
6. Pervasiveness of traditional development

These hurdles are common to any major effort to move an organization in a new direction. The transformation play describes some strategies to integrate change management, as well as OD concepts in an Agile transformation.


### Play: Guide your transformation

+ Discovery and Design: Collaboratively create a roadmap in a facilitated session; identify shared needs and vision statements. Plan and craft the message, ensuring it accurately portrays what the organization needs to know to support the Agile transformation. Stakeholder engagement and management starts with analysis to understand who needs to be engaged when. Identify everyone at every level affected by the transformation.

+ Generate Awareness and Desire for Change: Design communication plans to help to change hearts and minds. This stage is all about communicating the value proposition. The stakeholders need to be engaged to make sure everyone understands how and when it will affect them.

+ Training: The coalition of change agents ensures everyone has the tools to take on changes in roles and feels prepared to do so. Identify volunteers for changing roles, survey to understand what resistance there might be, and gather the information that everyone needs to feel they can succeed. Once trained, the stakeholders are ready to act, ensuring the transformation is a success for them.

+ Implementation (coaching leaders and mobilizing stakeholders): Frequently check on how the implementation is being received by employees at every level. Inform and adjust the message, training, or information needed to make the transformation a success. Through coaching, the stakeholders take ownership of the change to ensure this can be sustainable for them and the organization.

+ Sustainment (cultural change): Design incentives to change behavior and make it stick. Check in on a regular basis to ensure the organization’s behaviors are helping them achieve their vision, and to stretch them to find next visions for the organization for endless improvement.

## A Transformation Story

*Situation:* A commercial airline’s technology department mandated the implementation of Agile development practices to drive greater predictability and overall value creation. As a result, the enterprise data organization found itself needing to transform in a high-pressure environment where they were also responsible for delivering on key strategic enterprise projects. Having attempted the transformation unsuccessfully before, the enterprise data organization sought Agile coaches to support them in the design and implementation of an Agile methodology.

*Solution:* Booz Allen took a unique approach to delivering Agile coaching. After listening to the client, Booz Allen proposed a blended coaching solution where it partnered a traditional Agile coach with an organization transformation expert to support the teaching of Agile practices while also proactively managing the organizational change. Booz Allen started by validating the current state and identified five transformation themes to guide the organization during design. Booz Allen then helped the client to design Agile pod structures, create workflows, and assign roles. Booz Allen led the client in taking a collaborative design approach by engaging the team to create solutions and crowd-source ideas. Booz Allen provided guided implementation assistance that included activities like in-depth training for specific Agile roles and managers, observations of ceremonies and constructive feedback, adjustments to the performance management system, the establishment of an Agile Ambassador program to sustain change, and one-onone coaching for specific issues such as how to manage a pod with outsourced resources. Finally, Booz Allen began release planning to provide a roadmap for the way forward. Release planning will enable affinity groups with interdependencies to create long-term plans, mitigate risks and dependencies early, and provide transparency to the organization/program.

*Outcome and Value:* Booz Allen was able to convince a once-skeptical group of the benefits of Agile methodology and support them in a transformation journey that delivered better customer service to their internal partners and a more fulfilling working environment for their team. The enterprise data organization is now working more seamlessly with a transparent way to prioritize and deliver work. Booz Allen delivered more than just an Agile methodology. It cultivated an Agile mindset that will allow the organization to grow and scale and adapt to new demands.
