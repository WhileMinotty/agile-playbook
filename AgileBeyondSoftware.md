# Agile: Beyond Software Development

> “While 94 percent of respondents said their organizations practiced Agile, they also stated that more than half (60 percent) of their organizations’ teams are not yet practicing Agile.” –VersionOne State of Agile 2017

Agile is becoming more common in organizations and across projects, even outside of software development. There exists a constant call for work to be flexible and responsive to changing environments. Agile is known for increasing predictability, optimizing innovation, and accelerating teams. While software development folks may have been first to discover this way to make their teams more effective, the mindset and many practices can be adapted universally to improve teams. Teams in fields that interact with software development benefit from adopting Agile methods to have a common language and cadence with their software counterparts. Even outside of those interactions, iterative delivery, improvements, and customer interaction are always a good idea. You may not apply an Agile framework that looks exactly like a software project, but there will always be some gains in trying to be more agile.

This portion of the playbook takes a turn, sharing some fictional scenarios for teams outside of a software delivery context -- and how they gained from applying agile plays and methods, you'll find elsewhere in this document.
### Look For: Prioritized backlogs—Turn vision into action

A leadership team was having a difficult time trying to figure out how to approach a long list of requirements from their client. They treated all requirements as equal value and a must-have. Realistically, they knew that given their resources they would not be able to complete all of those requirements on time. They entered all these requirements into a to-do list to start a product backlog. They then started to prioritize this list by ranking the work that would provide the most value at the top. By having a prioritized list with a clear vision of what work was most valuable, everyone on those teams was able to focus on completing that work first before doing any other work. This increased focus, improved communication, and helped manage risk.

+ *Focus:* Instead of being pulled in different directions, each person on the team could now concentrate on the higher priority items since they knew that those items provided more value to the client.

+ *Foster better communication with the customer:* The client had a better understanding from the team that the original list of requirements was too large for them to finish within the given time period. Now leadership was able to give the client context about realistic workloads. This conversation allowed the client to reprioritize the work they valued versus nice-to-haves and not-nows. This relieved stress from the team and prevented them from rushing their work. They now had enough resources to reach their end goal and enough time to ensure quality and manage the customer expectations.

+ *Manage the risk of the customer changing their mind:* As the team completed work, the client was always informed of what the team would tackle next since the backlog was prioritized. The client had the ability to evaluate what was accomplished and move on to the next priority item or re-focus on a new item based on market needs as they occurred.

##### Managing risk/change: 
Backlogs are essentially to-do lists that collect all the work that must be done in one place, making it easier to prioritize and shift work around. With a backlog in place, new changes can be assessed with other previously prioritized tasks in mind. Managing items that seem risky because of unknowns or fluctuation becomes easier when they can be noted in the backlog.

### Look For: Radiate valuable data to the greatest extent possible

A brand new Human Resources team was organizing their quarterly plan. Each team member in his or her own mind had a long list of work that needed to be done. A task board in the form of a Kanban board was posted clearly for the whole team to consistently view, and helped them visualize the amount of work that needed to be done. This sort of visual touchstone helped with transparency, reporting, and decision support.

+ *Enables transparency:* After setting up the board, everyone on the team realized they had a lot of unspoken work to accomplish. Realizing so much work needed to be done also filled them with a sense of urgency. Individuals were previously having issues following through on tasks by taking on too many at once, without an understanding of the team’s larger picture. Once everyone had added all the items they thought needed to be done onto the board, everyone felt they could work together on common tasks and ask each other for help where there was capacity.

+ *Removes distraction of reporting:* Team members no longer had to check in with one another about work in progress. Anyone could view the task board and note what was being worked on or pick up assignments they had the bandwidth for, and management and the team could also clearly monitor overall progress.

+ *Real-time reporting enables faster decision making:* One team member was able to identify a gap in the work and added a new task they had not previously thought of before. Seeing the tasks on the board allowed everyone to focus on doing the work identified as important toward their quarterly goal.

##### Customer satisfaction: 
Information radiators display information not only to everyone on the team, but also to the client. Transparency is often highly valued so when a customer can see visible progress being made, it inspires confidence in a team and their work. Any amount of information—tasks, work in progress, work done, roadmaps, and more—can be publicly displayed to both the team and the client.

### Look For: Keep the clock in mind

A couple of commercial airline teams started organizing their work into 2-week blocks of time. This defined period of time, or timebox, was needed because they tended to work on large projects that dragged on for months and even years without being able to see much progress. Adding this timebox was beneficial for a few reasons:

+ *It established a predictable cadence to their leadership:* Leadership was previously in the dark and never knew when progress was made. Establishing this predictable cadence allowed them to check in and pivot the company’s strategies on a regular schedule based on team research. By knowing when they could expect progress, they could also focus on completing the objectives for the timebox and eliminate the need for extra follow-up. 

+ *It established predictable cadence for feedback from senior leadership and other stakeholders:* People previously had no feedback until someone called a meeting to find out about the work they had done; this only occurred on a quarterly or sometimes annual basis. Infrequent communication led to time wasted on tasks that were out of date or no longer important. Now, these team members knew if they were on the right track within 2 weeks. This way, teams consistently knew they were working on high priority items that were relevant to business needs.

+ *Enabled the team to get creative and experiment with how much work they could accomplish in 2 weeks:* Slicing everything up into 2 weeks’ worth of work allowed these teams to focus on completing manageably sized work and increase their sense of accomplishment. The team focused on completing these smaller chunks of work and noticed when tangent projects would derail their attention. They were able to deliver larger solutions more consistently because of their ability to break overwhelming tasks into much smaller pieces.

##### Speed: 
Timeboxing is key to improving your speed. You cannot only set a regular sprint cycle, but also set time limits for regular meetings. Sticking to set amounts of time for meetings and sprints shows others that you respect their time and gets everyone working toward a common goal within a common deadline.

### Look For: Reflect on how the team works together

A small company with a manufacturing and shipping team quickly started to scale due to increased product sales. This team was unable to fulfill a sudden increase of new products and wanted to inspect what was going on, so they incorporated weekly meetings to look back on how to improve and prepare themselves for the following week. These reflection periods, or retrospectives, became useful to evaluate ways to improve but more importantly they helped to:

+ *Improve the team, regardless of what they do:* As the team began to have retrospectives, they could agree on the things they were doing well and brainstorm solutions to problems that occurred the previous week. They gradually began to improve their speed and product quality by identifying processes or lack of processes that were holding them back. Through improved process, they saved 5 cents per manufactured bottle. By improving this one item in their production process, they were also able to reinvest the savings back to the team.

+ *Create a real team that can self-organize:* The team began to unite toward a common goal of improving production and shipping, empowering members to act on the ideas that came out of retrospectives. The team took ownership of actions meant to improve their work and recognized when processes needed adjustment. Since they required less oversight, they could work together as a more autonomous, self-organized team.

##### Improved quality: 
Retrospectives can give anyone the opportunity to pause, reflect, and improve. They are a great tool for self-reflection and collaboration, using individual feedback to identify lessons learned and adapt to a working environment. Incorporating retrospectives into your regularly scheduled work will provide more opportunities for both short- and long-term improvement

### Look For: Have valuable meetings

A new team was tasked with planning a large conference as a side project to their current work. Since everyone had different schedules and priorities, it was important to get as much value as possible out of their meetings. They began meeting daily for 15 minutes to discuss their commitments and anything they might need assistance with. This helped them with:
+ *Transparency:* Team members could regularly communicate about what needed to be done and who had the bandwidth to do it. It helped them address time constraints, share ideas about next steps, and work daily toward the common goal of a successful conference.

+ *Communication:* Even with time as a scarce resource, the team was able to regularly communicate about what needed to be done and who was doing it. Giving the team time to connect also allowed them to ask for help by providing resources or knowledge sharing.

+ *Cadence:* Setting a regular time to connect kept the team on task and delivering consistently, even with other work on their plates. Their daily cadence allowed them to adjust based on availability and quickly identify and address impediments to their work. Distractions were better managed, and conference content was consistently addressed and reviewed.

##### Flow: 
Daily commitment meetings keep a regular cadence with others and ensure that work flows without impediment. They give individuals opportunities to regularly connect, provide information to one another, and self-organize so that the highest priority tasks are done first.

### Look For: Limiting work in progress

A team of intelligence analysts who write reports based on requests for information used the technique of limiting their work in progress to help make predictable commitments to requestors. Originally, all requests came in through the team lead, who would assign them based on her knowledge of their workload and the average length to complete. The team was regularly missing deadlines due to a long queue of work. The team set up a Kanban board where each person limited their workload to two items at a time and tracked their work in progress. The team was then able to:

+ *Focus:* Limiting the individual workload helped everyone focus on completing their work before taking on new work. Since they no longer had to rush to complete their long to-do lists, the team’s quality of work improved and they were able to deliver their reports more frequently.

+ *Understand the workload:* This also helped the team lead visualize the amount of work waiting to be completed so she could assess how long it would take to complete new requests. The team lead could calculate the wait time based on the items before the new request in the queue and give more reliable completion dates. With more predictable commitments and deliveries, requestors were satisfied with the team’s capabilities and had faith in the quality of their work.
