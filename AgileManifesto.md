# Agile Manifesto

## Reflections on the Agile Manifesto

We’ve reproduced the [_Manifesto for Agile Software Development_](http://www.agilemanifesto.org) in its entirety for this new version of the playbook. The _Manifesto_ is as relevant in 2018 as it was revolutionary in 2001, and serves as the foundation for all of the practices in this playbook. Below are our reflections on the Manifesto's four values. You'll see these values and principles referenced throughout the playbook.

#### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Organizations are made of people—we need to concentrate on how those people communicate and collaborate. We still need to have processes and tools, but they should not come at the expense of rich communication that creates deeper understanding and connections within the organization. Processes and tools should be frameworks and proven practices that are applied to solve specific problems via communication, not blindly because they are on a checklist.

#### Working software over comprehensive documentation
Documentation is still necessary, but we are looking for the minimum number of documents and the minimum amount of content needed to provide value without getting weighed down. We don’t want the tradition of extensive documentation before starting the project to get in the way of delivering valuable software to the consumer as quickly as possible.

#### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Work performed often requires a contract, but we want to make sure we understand the true needs rather than only following what the contract says was needed at signing. Understanding the need means working alongside those who are requesting the work and being open to discovering relevant information. Delivering value means we will understand that need and meet it.

#### Responding to change over following a plan
We want to make sure we are creating the best solution by reflecting on the work done on a regular basis, and acting on what we learn to improve the solution. The people doing the work should be able to use their best judgement to make localized decisions on project work— rather than what they are told will work or what the original plan dictates—to accomplish the goal. 

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

_Reproduced in its entirety_

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

_We follow these principles:_

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.


Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently,  from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to  and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software/solutions is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity—-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—-is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
