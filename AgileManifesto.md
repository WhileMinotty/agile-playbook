# Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:


**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan



That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.



### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Organizations are made of people—we need to concentrate on how those people communicate and collaborate. We still need to have processes and tools, but they should not come at the expense of rich communication that creates deeper understanding and connections within the organization. Processes and tools should be frameworks and proven practices that are applied to solve specific problems via communication, not blindly because they are on a checklist.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation
Documentation is still necessary, but we are looking for the minimum number of documents and the minimum amount of content needed to provide value without getting weighed down. We don’t want the tradition of extensive documentation before starting the project to get in the way of delivering valuable software to the consumer as quickly as possible.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Work performed often requires a contract, but we want to make sure we understand the true needs rather than only following what the contract says was needed at signing. Understanding the need means working alongside those who are requesting the work and being open to discovering relevant information. Delivering value means we will understand that need and meet it.

### Responding to change over following a plan
We want to make sure we are creating the best solution by reflecting on the work done on a regular basis, and acting on what we learn to improve the solution. The people doing the work should be able to use their best judgement to make localized decisions on project work— rather than what they are told will work or what the original plan dictates—to accomplish the goal. 

## Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the
 customer through early and continuous
 delivery of valuable software.


2. Welcome changing requirements, even
late in development. Agile processes 
harness change for the customer’s
competitive advantage.


3. Deliver working software frequently, 
from a couple of weeks to a couple of
 months, with a preference for the
shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must
 work together daily throughout the 
project. 

5. Build projects around motivated 
individuals. Give them the environment
and support they need, and trust them 
to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective
 method of conveying information to 
and within a development team is
 face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software/solutions is the 
primary measure of progress.



8. Agile processes promote sustainable
 development. The sponsors, 
developers, and users should be able to 
maintain a constant pace indefinitely.



9. Continuous attention to technical
 excellence and good design enhances 
agility.

10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the 
amount of work not done—is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements,
 and designs emerge from selforganizing 
teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects 
on how to become more effective, then 
tunes and adjusts its behavior
accordingly.
