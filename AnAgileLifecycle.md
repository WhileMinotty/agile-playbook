### An Agile Lifecycle

In this section, we introduce a simple "Agile Lifecycle" to help provide some useful context for the plays described in this document.
Our experience has taught us that nearly all (good) projects
-- regardless of method, framework, or practices -- 
tend to follow along this same general path.

While depicted in sequence, 
it is important to understand that this is for simplicity and discussion only.
Projects generally start-up in this way, 
but they will likely execute these stages (or phases?) as needed
-- and often in parallel -- throughout the life of the project.

#### Concept & Alignment

Before we can get to work, we must first understand our target and our team.

In the **Concept & Alignment** stage, 
the team begins to build relationships with their stakeholders and users.
Together, they will build a shared understanding of 
the project vision, goals, values, and expectations.
They may employ [Chartering Meetings](TODO) to build [product roadmaps](TODO) and [user personas](TODO), and capture [strategic themes](TODO).

The team should also establish [working agreements](TODO) 
-- these identify how they will communicate, resolve conflict, and have fun, among other things --
and technical expectations, such as [coding standards](TODO) and their [definitions of done](TODO).

And, this all should take place _in a matter of days_.
We want to get the team delivering as quickly as possible -- that is where the learning truly occurs and value is delivered.

#### Initiate & Prepare

Once the team, stakeholders, and users are aligned on the project vision and working arrangements, they should do _just enough planning_ to get the team delivering.

The **Initiate & Prepare** stage is where the team [builds](TODO?) and [estimates](TODO) an initial [backlog](TODO).
For longer efforts, they [may even sketch out a few sprints](TODO-releaseplanningplay?) over the next 3 months (but no more, really).

Oftentimes, we find it beneficial when teams execute this stage within the cadence of their choosing.
When teams do this, it is sometimes called [Sprint 0](TODO),
and, in addition to putting together their first plans,
they may [knock out some valuable development and deployment infrastructure tasks](TODO).
This will set the team up to really hit the ground running when they start delivering against the project's goals.

#### Deliver

This is where the rubber hits the road, so to speak.

Leveraging one of the [agile delivery frameworks](/plays/Delivery.md),
the team works to transform the needs of their users into valuable, tested, potentially shippable software.
