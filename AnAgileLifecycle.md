### An Agile Lifecycle

In this section, we introduce a simple "Agile Lifecycle" to help provide some useful context for the plays described in this document.
Through our experience as practitioners, we've found that nearly all (good) projects
-- regardless of method, framework, or practices -- 
tend to follow along this same general path.

//TODO (edit): While depicted in sequence, 
it is important to understand that this is for simplicity and discussion only.
Projects generally start-up in this way, 
but they will likely execute these stages (or phases?) as needed
-- and often in parallel -- throughout the life of the project.

#### Concept & Alignment

Before we can get to work, we must first understand our target and our team.

In the **Concept & Alignment** stage, 
the team begins to build relationsips with their stakeholders and users.
Together, they will build a shared understanding of 
the project vision, goals, values, and expectations.  
They may employ [Chartering Meetings](TODO) to build [product roadmaps](TODO) and [user personas](TODO), and capture [strategic themes](TODO).

The team should also establish [working agreements](TODO) 
-- these identify how they will communicate, resolve conflict, and have fun, among other things --
and technical expectations, such as [coding standards](TODO) and their [definitions of done](TODO).

And, this all should take place in a matter of days.
We want to get the team to Delivery as quickly as possible -- that is where the learning truly occurs and value is delivered.

#### Initiate & Prepare

Just enough planning to get started.

build an initial backlog, estimate it, sketch out a few sprints
