###BOOZ ALLEN STANDARD AGILE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS— SMARTSUITE
Tools used by the project team that address automation, communication, and work tracking activities provide a valuable resource for planning and managing its Agile project efficiently and effectively. Agile teams select tools that make sense for executing their project and provide the most value, such as capabilities to enable requirements gathering, Sprint planning, progress tracking, and reporting. Although the use of tools provides a great benefit,   tools do not get the work done—those who use the tools do.

###SMARTSUITE
Booz Allen has invested in an integrated suite of commercial tools known as SmartSuite, a comprehensive application lifecycle management platform that supports programs that have adopted the Agile mindset. Our investment in enterprise licenses with vendors such as Atlassian® (JIRA®/Greenhopper®), JAMA® (Contour), and HP® (Quality Center) allows Agile teams to quickly establish their development and lifecycle management environments without the need to procure new licenses or pass along costs to our customers.

###BENEFITS OF A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS
SmartSuite tools (see Figure 13) are modeled after two Agile disciplines: the Agile Product Owner and the Agile Team. These disciplines are tailored specifically for enterprise environments based on lessons learned from successful Agile projects.
SmartSuite provides Agile teams the ability to:

* Quickly establish their application lifecycle management solution, as opposed to setting up a new environment, or procuring new tools
* Provide access to clients via secure cloud hosting in our Center for Network and Systems Innovation (CNSI) environment
* Create User Stories and generate prioritized Product Backlog to focus delivery on the customers’ most important product features
* Generate Sprint planning and Burndown metrics to provide real-time transparency into project progress
* Easily incorporate continuous integration activities into the development process, resulting in quality and productivity gains
* Conduct defect management activities in a manner that reflects traceability to requirements, design, and code
* Automate code reviews and functional testing to identify quality issues early, when they are less expensive to correct.

Two distinct methodologies, SmartSpin for the Agile Product Owner and SmartStart for the Agile team, integrate best practices to enhance the value derived from Agile implementation. SmartSpin (Software Product Management and Innovation) assists the Product Owner with capturing requirements, prioritizing the Product Backlog, defining User Stories, etc., while SmartStart (Smart Sharing of Technology Applications Resources and Tools) provides the Agile Team with preconfigured environments and tools to assist in product delivery.
