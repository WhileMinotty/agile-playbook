# Getting started - Your first month (or so)
So you've never been an agile team before. How to get started?

This guide gives a quick frame for getting started, tying together concepts you'll find more detail about in other areas of this playbook. 
Not all the terms are explained, so you'll want to reference the rest of the playbook to find more context and advice.

Keep in mind, it's not practical to totally change everything about how you work overnight. Start here: try these ideas and improve as you go.
