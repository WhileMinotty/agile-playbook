//TODO:  Introductory text; Agile is a mindset; some history; what and why of Agile

We view Agile as a mindset – defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through countless practices - and actively encourage industry to embrace this definition.  Indeed, Agile should not simply equate to delivering software in "Sprints" or a handful of "best practices" you can read in a book – but rather represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven delivery, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. Products and sytems built using agile methods are shown to be delivered at a faster pace, lower cost, higher quality, and a greater level of customer satisfaction. Agile techniques cannot magically eliminate challenges intrinsic to high-discovery software development. But, by focusing on continuous delivery of incremental value and shorter feedback cycles, they do expose these challenges as early as possible, while there is still time to correct for them. As agile practitioners, we embrace the innate mutability of software and harness that flexibility for the benenfit of our customers and users. 

We've come to this perspective by being software pracitioners, living in the trenches and delivering software on teams using increasingly modern methods, and in support of dozens of customers across the US Government and international commercial market.  The following few sections provide further elaboration on this perspective.


### //TODO:  On Delivery and Value

A central concept to how teams accomplish work in agile environments is understanding the place for Delivery and for Value. We use these words to distinguish how the work gets done versus what the work needs to accomplish.

While many teams have an official Product Owner to represent the value of the project, we want you to understand these perspectives exist whether we assign people to them or not. 

It is the job of Value to dream big and ask for the moon. It is the job of Delivery to speak to what's possible and communicate the cost of the work. This healthy tension drives us toward a common agreed solution that is predictable in its execution and fit for purpose.

We recommend explicitly acknowledging the relationship between Delivery and Value, and we use terms like Delivery Team and Value Team to help us understand what each others' focus may be -- but it's crucial to consider that, together, we are still one team, with one goal, and must find our own unified path to reach that goal.

//TODO: Always be delivering? Quick wins?


### //TODO:  On the importance of Teams

We cannot have a conversation about agile delivery without speaking about teams. A team is the core of any agile organization. In a project of two people or two-hundred -- the work happens in teams. And at the core of teams are humans. Just as we seek to build products that delight the humans who use them, we seem to be happier, more productive humans at work, enjoying the company of one another, and the challenge of solving an interesting problem together.

Great agile teams are high-performing, self-improving, accountable to each other, and can work through conflict. "Self-organizing teams" is a term thrown around in agile conversations. It's true: we believe the best solutions to the problems at hand emerge from cross-functional teams working tightly together; but this presupposes that we are, in fact, a team. All too often, a group of people are simply told, "You're an agile team, self-organize around this problem, and be done by May." Leadership has a responsibility here to grow a true team that trusts one another and has the skills and resources necessary for success; then, we can consider the notion of self-organization.


### //TODO:  On the importance of Craftsmanship

Agile software engineering is still software engineering. Ron Jeffries tells us, "To be fit for purpose, the software we build has to be robust enough to support the business need. It needs to be sufficiently free of defects to be usable and desirable. It needs to be well structured enough to allow us to sustain its development as long as required.

Robust, reliable, well designed. These are not things that we just automatically get by having a Product Owner and a Scrum Master. Much less are these things we get by having really good Portfolio Vision and an Agile Release Train... If we do not build it well, all our teamwork, communication, retrospectives, business focus and WIP limitation are for nothing."

Delivering great systems requires a dedication to the craft and an eye toward excellence. Technical agility and strength is necessary for teams to be truly agile, but is often overlooked in the conversation. We encourage you to continually examine our own technical capability, architecture, and skill as we journey through new ways to work.

###POSITION STATEMENT
Booz Allen Hamilton (Booz Allen) views Agile as a “mindset,” defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through many different practices. In other words, Agile does not simply equate to delivering software in “Sprints,” but rather represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven development, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. These tenets, codified in the Agile Manifesto1  (statement of values/principles supporting ideals of Agile software development), have proven, when dutifully applied to software and systems delivery, to result in more valuable products at a faster pace, lower cost, higher quality, and with greater levels of customer satisfaction. Agile will not overcome all the challenges inherent to developing software. However, by focusing on incremental value and shorter feedback cycles, Agile practices seek to expose development challenges as early as possible so that they can be addressed in real time. To this extent, Agile embraces the innate mutability of software and employs that flexibility for the benefit of our clients.

We have applied Agile systems development practices (e.g., continuous integration, test-driven development, sprint planning) at Booz Allen for nearly 10 years. Because we have supported dozens of agencies across all markets, we can currently point to more than 60 active systems development projects successfully delivering software through implementation of the Agile mindset. These projects range in size and complexity from small mobile application development efforts involving fewer than 3 staff members, to complex enterprise solutions supported by more than 100 project team members. Despite these successes, misconceptions remain that the adoption of the Agile mindset and practices may compromise high-performance delivery or high-quality work products. Clients should be reassured that our approach to Agile is a responsible one, as evidenced by the successful Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI®)2  Maturity Level 3 appraisals of Booz Allen projects delivered using Agile practices.

The firm has invested heavily in training, tools, and resources to facilitate adoption and implementation of the Agile mindset and practices. Our Learning and Development team has developed a formal partnership in alignment with the International Consortium for Agile (ICAgile). We have more than 50 certified Scrum Masters and Project Management Institute (PMI) Certified Agile Professionals, and more than 400 developers trained in the Agile mindset and practices. The Agile Software Development Community of Practice (CoP) has been in place for nearly 5 years. With more than 350 members, it serves as a clearinghouse to share best practices and to stay abreast of emerging trends in the domain. Finally, our SmartSuite™ environment is a set of firm wide enterprise tools, processes, and intellectual capital that can be tailored to support Agile delivery in the areas of document management, team collaboration, continuous integration, requirements management, automated code reviews, testing, and defect tracking.

###WHY A PLAYBOOK?
Since publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, perception of Agile has shifted from an innovative, leading-edge perspective on systems delivery to a more foundational approach embraced broadly by industry and adopted widely by our clients. The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report in 2012 in support of its use of Agile, sharing best practices and some of the challenges it faced while adopting some Agile development techniques (see Appendix E). Other agencies to which Booz Allen delivers systems development support (e.g., Department of Homeland Security) have also gone so far as to create their own interpretation of the Agile Manifesto.

Despite this broadening adoption, industry standards or baselines do not exist for Agile development. ICAgile was founded to define and govern learning objectives and certifications for the greater Agile industry, and PMI rolled out the Agile Certified
Practitioner (PMI-ACP)® certification, but these learning guidelines do not represent a standard, as do CMMI or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. As a result, there are many interpretations of the Agile mindset among clients and our own systems development community. Inconsistent adoption of the Agile mindset and practices reflects varying maturity levels and implementation strategies.
The purpose of this playbook is to educate new adopters of the Agile mindset about the proven practices that have worked successfully at Booz Allen and to serve as the foundation for implementing Agile at the firm in the midst of this shifting environment. The practices presented in this playbook represent some of the best the Agile Community has to offer on team organization and chartering, work estimation and planning, and technical excellence
