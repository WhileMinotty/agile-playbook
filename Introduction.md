# Introduction

Agile is the de facto way of delivering software today. Compared to waterfall development, agile projects are far more likely to deliver on time, on budget, and having met the customer’s need. Despite this broad adoption, industry standards remain elusive due to the nature of agility—there is no single set of best practices.

The purpose of this playbook is to educate new adopters of the agile mindset by curating many of the good practices that we’ve found work for teams at Booz Allen. As we offer our perspective on implementing agile in your context, we present many “plays”—use cases of agile practices that may work for you, and which together can help weave an overall approach for tighter delivery and more satisfied customers.

Core to our perspective are the following themes, which reverberate throughout this playbook. We’ve come to these themes as software practitioners living in the trenches and delivering software on teams using increasingly modern methods, and in support of dozens of customers across the U.S. Government and the international commercial market.

* **Agile is a mindset.** We view agile as a mindset—defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through emergent practices—and actively encourage industry to embrace this definition. Indeed, agile should not simply equate to delivering software in sprints or a handful of best practices you can read in a book. Rather, agile represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven delivery, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. Agile techniques cannot magically eliminate the challenges intrinsic to high-discovery software development. But, by focusing on continuous delivery of incremental value and shorter feedback cycles, they do expose these challenges as early as possible, while there is still time to correct for them. As agile practitioners, we embrace the innate mutability of software and harness that flexibility for the benefit of our customers and users. As you start a new project, or have an opportunity to retool an existing one, we urge you to lean to agile for its reduced risk and higher customer satisfaction.
* **Flexibility as the standard, with discipline and intention.** Booz Allen Systems Delivery uses a number of frameworks across projects, depending on client preferences and what fits best. We use Scrum, Kanban, waterfall, spiral, and the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), as well as hybrid approaches. But we embrace agile as our default approach, and Scrum specifically as our foundational method, if it fits the scope and nature of the work.
* **One team, multiple focuses.** Throughout this playbook, we explicitly acknowledge the symbiotic relationship between delivery (responsible for the “how”) and value (responsible for the “what”), and we use terms like “delivery team” and “value team” to help us understand what each team member’s focus may be. However, it’s crucial to consider that, together, we are still one team, with one goal, and we seek a common path to reach that goal.
* **Work is done by teams.  Teams are made of humans.** A team is the core of any agile organization. In a project of 2 people or 200, the work happens in teams. And at the core of teams are humans. Just as we seek to build products that delight the humans who use them, we seek to be happier, more connected, more productive humans at work.
* **As we move faster, we cannot sacrifice security.** According to the U. S. Digital Service, nearly 25% of visits to government websites are for nefarious purposes. As we lean toward rapid delivery and modern practice, we must stay security-minded. Security cannot be a phase-gate or an after-thought; we must bring that perspective into our whole team, our technology choices, and our engineering approach. 

### Who should use this playbook?

This playbook was written primarily for new adopters of agile practices, and it is intended to speak to managers, practitioners, and teams. While initially written as a guide solely for Booz Allen Systems Delivery professionals, it is our hope that the community will also find value in our experience. We have deliberately minimized Booz Allen-specific “inside baseball” language wherever possible. 

A Booz Allen internal addendum is also available for Booz Allen staff, with links and information only relevant for them. This is not because it is full of “secret sauce” proprietary information; rather, it is to keep the community version accessible and broadly valuable.

### How should you use this playbook?

This playbook is not intended to be read as a narrative document.  It is organized, at a high level, as follows:

1. **Agile Playbook context.** This is what you are reading now. We introduce the playbook, provide a high-level “Agile Model,” and offer some parting thoughts.
1. **The plays.** The plays are the meat of the playbook and are intended to be used as references. Plays describe valuable patterns that we believe agile teams should broadly consider—they are “the what.” Within many plays, we describe techniques for putting them into practice. Plays are grouped into nine categories: Delivery, Value, Teams, Craftsmanship, Measurement, Management, Adaptation, Meetings, and Agile at scale.

### Agile Playbook v2.5 - What's new? 

This is version 2.5 of our Agile Playbook. The first edition was published in 2013 and aided many practitioners in adopting and maturing their agile practice across our client deliveries and internal efforts. In June 2016, we created version 2.0, expanding that content, especially around agile at scale and DevOps, and transforming what was an internal playbook into an external publication— open source and publicly available. This version focuses on adding more topics outside of strictly software and teams. It expands on management and organizational topics while adding some nuances to the existing topics such as Design Thinking for unknown solutions.

#### Our Digital Hubs

Over the last 4 years, our digital business and footprint has grown by leaps and bounds, in part through our acquisitions of the software services unit SPARC in Charleston, South Carolina and the digital services firm Aquilent in Laurel, Maryland. These digital hubs are part of our Digital Solutions Network, where integrated teams of digital professionals collaborate to solve our clients’ toughest problems. Within this virtual network, we’re able to help our clients in more places, and with more expertise. Our hubs create a tight-knit community for our technologists and innovators to exchange ideas and combine their expertise in cloud, mobile, advanced analytics, social, and IoT with modern techniques, including user-centered design, agile, DevOps, and open source. 

#### Reminder: Best *learning* practices

The first playbook referred to itself as a collection of best practices, but we want to clarify that. In most cases these are best *learning* practices. If you need a place to start or you want to understand something in context, we hope this playbook serves as a valuable guide and helps you keep walking toward high performance as a team or program. But, just as guitar virtuosos or Olympic skiers have moved past the form and rules they learned in their first few weeks of practice, we expect our delivery teams to learn the values here, start with the learning practices, and eventually innovate their way toward even higher performance methods that are unique to them.

### How and where can you contribute to this playbook?

We want to build this playbook as a community.  If you have ideas or experiences (or find a typo or broken link) you wish to share, we would love to hear about it.  Contributions can be sent in one of two ways:

* Pull requests
* Email us at agile@bah.com—patch files preferred, but any feedback is welcome.

We welcome feedback on the entire playbook, but we are looking for contributions in a few particular areas:

* New play or practice descriptions
* Reports or articles from the ground, completely attributed to you
* Favorite tools and software for inclusion in our tools compendium
* Additional references or further reading

Please be sure to take a look at our [style guide](../../wiki/Style-Guide) before submitting feedback.
