### Why a Playbook?
Agile is the de-facto way of delivering software today. Compared to "waterfall" developent, Agile projects are far more likely to deliver on time, on budget, and having met the customer's need. Despite this broad adoption, industry standards or baselines remain nascent for Agile development. 

The purpose of this playbook is to educate new adopters of the Agile mindset by curating many good practices that are proven to work for teams at Booz Allen. As we offer our perspective on implementing agile in your context, we present many "plays" -- use cases of agile practices that may work for you, and together can help weave an overall approach for tighter delivery and more satsified customers.

### Agile is a mindset
We view Agile as a mindset – defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through countless practices - and actively encourage industry to embrace this definition.  Indeed, Agile should not simply equate to delivering software in "Sprints" or a handful of "best practices" you can read in a book – but rather represents a way of thinking that embraces change, regular feedback, value-driven delivery, full-team collaboration, learning through discovery, and continuous improvement. Products and systems built using agile methods are shown to be delivered at a faster pace, lower cost, higher quality, and a greater level of customer satisfaction. Agile techniques cannot magically eliminate challenges intrinsic to high-discovery software development. But, by focusing on continuous delivery of incremental value and shorter feedback cycles, they do expose these challenges as early as possible, while there is still time to correct for them. As agile practitioners, we embrace the innate mutability of software and harness that flexibility for the benenfit of our customers and users. 

We've come to this perspective as software pracitioners, living in the trenches and delivering software on teams using increasingly modern methods, and in support of dozens of customers across the US Government and international commercial market.  The following few sections provide further elaboration on this perspective.


### On Delivery and Value
A central concept to how teams accomplish work in agile environments is understanding the place for Delivery and for Value. We use these words to distinguish how the work gets done versus what the work needs to accomplish.

While many teams have an official Product Owner to represent the value of the project, we want you to understand the Delivery and Value perspectives exist in every project, whether we assign people to them or not. 

It is the job of Value to dream big and ask for the moon. It is the job of Delivery to speak to what's possible and communicate the cost of the work. This healthy tension drives us toward a common agreed solution that is predictable in its execution and fit for purpose.

We recommend explicitly acknowledging the relationship between Delivery and Value, and we use terms like Delivery Team and Value Team to help us understand what each others' focus may be:  but it's crucial to consider that, together, we are still one team, with one goal, and we seek a common path to reach that goal.

### On Teams
We cannot have a conversation about agile delivery without speaking about teams. A team is the core of any agile organization. In a project of two people or two-hundred -- the work happens in teams. And at the core of teams are humans. Just as we seek to build products that delight the humans who use them, we seek to be happier, more productive humans at work, enjoying the company of one another, and the challenge of solving an interesting problem together.

Great agile teams are high-performing, self-improving, accountable to each other, and can work through conflict. "Self-organizing" is a term thrown around in agile conversations to describe how teams are supposed to work. It's true: we believe the best solutions to the problems at hand emerge from cross-functional teams working tightly together; but this presupposes that we are, in fact, a team. All too often, a group of people are simply told, "You're an agile team, self-organize around this problem, and be done by May." Leadership has a responsibility here to grow a true team that trusts one another and has the skills and resources necessary for success; then, we can consider the notion of self-organization.

Software is built by teams. So, if we are going to talk about productivity, our team's output is the only figure that matters. One person's contribution is not important unless it is in concert with the total team's delivery. The era of the software developer who can sit alone, producing valuable code is over. Today's solutions are a convergence of domain expertise and technical craft, with quality built in from the beginning. This requires a cross-functional, collaborative, communicative team. Leaders have a responsibility to form, foster, and recognize teams that work well together and share a common responsibility for the whole delivery.

### On Craftsmanship
Agile software engineering is still software engineering. Ron Jeffries tells us, "To be fit for purpose, the software we build has to be robust enough to support the business need. It needs to be sufficiently free of defects to be usable and desirable. It needs to be well structured enough to allow us to sustain its development as long as required.

Robust, reliable, well designed. These are not things that we just automatically get by having a Product Owner and a Scrum Master. Much less are these things we get by having really good Portfolio Vision and an Agile Release Train... If we do not build it well, all our teamwork, communication, retrospectives, business focus and WIP limitation are for nothing."

Delivering great systems requires a dedication to the craft and an eye toward excellence. Technical agility and strength is necessary for teams to be truly agile, but is often overlooked in the conversation. We encourage you to continually examine our own technical capability, architecture, and skill as we journey through new ways to work.

### On management
Is the role for management lessened in an agile environment? It's a common question - and the answer is no! Agile teams still need to plan, still need to manage dependencies, still need to collaborate with customers and stakeholderss. Teams still need staff, opportunities for growth, and effort to address risks. Good managers are vital to agile project success, but the role typically takes on a different character than traditionally expected.

Agile managers grow a tolerance for a healthy level of ambiguity and uncertainty that is intrinsic to today's modern knowledge work. Agile managers also take a keen focus on people and environment: How can we improve communication? How can we lift up our teams? How can we make this a great project to work on? How can we all take part on the project's vision?
