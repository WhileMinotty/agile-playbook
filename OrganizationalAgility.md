##Organizational Agility or Agile at scale:

Agile at scale is more than simply applying agile practices on multiple teams. Agile at scale requires multiple levels of coordination to ensure all the teams are moving in the same direction within the enterprise. Other aspects such as culture and funding must be considered as well. Implementing Agile in an organization cannot be top down or grass roots alone. A successful implementation must include both. Itâ€™s for this reason we must address applying agile practices at the team level in addition, we must train the managers and executives as well.
