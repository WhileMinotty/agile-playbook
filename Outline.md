    - _The themes discussed here provide some hint to the structure of the "plays" in the meat of the document.  This will be fairly concise and succint_
    - The Agile Mindset, brief history - the what and why of Agile.
    - On Value and Delivery
      - The distinction between what work gets done and how it gets accomplished as a frame for how we approach Agile teams and practices
    - On Teams
      - The importance of teams to any conversation about agile, as the core building block of delivery
    - On Craftsmanship
      - The importance of building quality into the solution and taking pride in delivery
    - On Management
      - Explicity identifying the importance of management on agile teams, even if the complexion changes.

- An Agile Lifecycle
  - _Introduce the 3-phase Agile Lifecycle, consistent with the Agile Fundamentals class and OSP Next Gen_
  - _Include a Lifecycle Graphic_
  - Concept & Alignment
  - Initiate & Prepare
  - Deliver
  
- Getting started - _"So, you've decided to be an Agile team?"_
  - _Collection of good 'getting started' plays described throughout the document_
  - E.g. Use Scrum Framework, adopt simple team structure, use good engineering practices like TDD/CI
  
- The "Plays" - _(Unsure if this metaphor will continue to live as a construct)_
  - Delivery
    - Play: Scrum Framework, especially for teams new to agile.
    - Play: Kanban, when teams need or want to deliver as frequently as possible and flow is paramount, e.g. when O&M is the primary focus.
      - Possibly describe combination of the two, e.g. ScrumBan
  - Value
    - User Stories, Acceptance Criteria
    - Prioritization considerations and techniques
    - Human Centered Design?

  - Teams
    - Scrum teams, as a frame for conversation about roles
      - Product Owner, owns the Value
      - Scrum Master, facilitates the process
      - Delivery Team - owns the Delivery. Cross-functional in nature, developers, testers
    - On team size
      - A squad of less than 10 people is the simplest, looks like a text-book Scrum Team.
      - Introduce a Value Team as the complexity or importance of the value-decisions expands.
      - Expanding to multiple Delivery teams and Value teams
    - Creating team-ness
