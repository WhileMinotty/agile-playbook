# The Booz Allen Agile Playbook

Welcome to the Booz Allen Agile Playbook. The purpose of this playbook is to educate new adopters of the agile mindset by curating many of the good practices that we’ve found work for teams at Booz Allen. This playbook was written primarily for new adopters of agile practices, and it is intended to speak to managers, practitioners, and teams.  It is our hope that the community will also find value in and build on our experience; this is why we're building it in the open and releasing it under Creative Commons
