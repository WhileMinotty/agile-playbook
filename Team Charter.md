* Definitions
  * Definition of DONE: How will we define done on our team? Getting on the same page about this and having the discussion up front and being able to refer back to it will save the team later. Revisit what done means to you once in a while to make sure you update it as things change. (ex. Passed unit tests, documentation done, peer reviewed, code checked in…)
  * Definition of READY: How can we make sure something is ready to be worked or ready to be planned? (ex. Meets INVEST criteria; independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable) 
  * Product Vision: It’s important to know where you are going as a team. As a Pod as part of the larger team, what is the vision for the larger team? What is the vision for your particular Project/Group? 
  * Estimation: What estimation scale/ points are we using? Will we estimate using planning poker?
