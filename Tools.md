# Tools

### Knowledge Share/Collaboration
Knowledge sharing and collaboration appears in many forms from formalized training to informal chats to white boarding sessions to storage of documents to collaborative authoring and everything in between. Because the breadth of the tools available combined with their strengths and weaknesses, teams are encouraged to assess their goals prior to evaluating and selecting a tool.

### Test Automation
Automated tests help the team identify and resolve issues before users do when it is least expensive to fix. Prior to committing the code, it can be executing on a development team member's workstation can be quickly verified and validated with automated tests. This helps team members ensure their new code is compatible with the existing functionality. The tests can be committed with the code easing access and maintenance while encouraging reuse.

Allows the Value team to prioritize the Product Backlog while the Delivery team can build the Sprint Backlog and Burndown thus focusing on the delivery of the customers’ most important product features. Defect management activities are conducted in a manner that reflects traceability to requirements, design, and code. Facilitates the collection of metrics and the display of Information Radiators to provide real-time transparency into project progress.
