###APPENDIX A: US GAO REPORT

In July 2012, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO)9  published a report describing the use of Agile in the Federal Government and also in the private sector for small to medium sized projects and some larger projects. The report supports the use of Agile and identifies some effective practices in applying Agile, but also includes information regarding some federal challenges in following some of the Agile development techniques.
A total of 32 practices and approaches were categorized into 5 key project management (PM) activities: strategic planning, organizational commitment and collaboration, preparation, execution, and evaluation. Table 4 below provides a list of 10 practices used by the 5 projects surveyed that were found to be most effective in applying Agile practices and presents how the Booz Allen approach maps to each of the practice statements. It is noteworthy to mention that four of the five federal software development projects surveyed and identified in the GAO report embraced Scrum as their approach to implementing Agile.

**Table 4:Effective Agile Practices**

| Number | GAO Practice Statement | PM Activity | Execution | Mapped Playbook Content |  
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- | 
| 1 | Start with Agile guidance and an Agile adoption strategy | Strategic Planning | Ensure these elements are in place at the start of the project | Create the Agile team | 
| 2 | Enhance migration to Agile concepts using Agile terms and examples | Preparation | Ensure use of applicable terminology, for instance, user stories instead of requirements | Create the Agile team | 
| 3 | Continuously improve Agile adoption at both project and organization levels | Evaluation | Invoke the practice of continuous improvement | Conduct the Sprint Retrospective | 
| 4 | Seek to identify and address impediments at the organization and project levels | Evaluation | Encourage response from both the organization and project | The Agile Rhythm— Daily Standup Meetings | 
| 5 | Obtain stakeholder/customer feedback frequently and closely | Evaluation | Ensure reduction in risk, improving customer commitment and improving technical staff motivation | The Agile Rhythm—Daily Standup Meetings| 
| 6 | Empower small, cross-functional teams | Organizational Commitment/ Collaboration | Provide approach for team-based decision-making. | Create the Agile Team | 
| 7 | Include requirements related to security and progress monitoring in your queue of unfinished work | Execution | Ensure security reviews and status briefings included in the backlog are addressed concurrently with the iteration delivery | Create Product Backlog | 
| 8 | Gain trust by demonstrating value at the end of each iteration | Evaluation | Assure customers that key requirements (user stories) in the backlog have been delivered | Conduct the Sprint Review | 
| 9 | Track progress using tools and metrics | Evaluation | Use burndown charts and velocity for tracking progress and success | Collecting Metrics | 
| 10 | Track progress daily and visibly | Evaluation | Ensure timely revisions and ongoing feedback | The Agile Rhythm--Daily standup meetings |
