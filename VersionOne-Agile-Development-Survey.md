###APPENDIX B: VERSIONONE® AGILE DEVELOPMENT SURVEY

VersionOne®, an enterprise software company dedicated to Agile lifecycle management, surveyed software professionals regarding their use of Agile in relation to current trends, successes, and lessons learned. Results of this survey were presented in the State  of Agile Development Survey for 2012 (VersionOne®)8. An overview of the findings in several areas that would help a project team determine where they fall in the continuum of incorporating Agile best practices in their approach is as follows:
* **Agile Adoption and Use** > Organizations are moving from implementing single Agile teams/projects to multiple Agile teams/ projects; use of Scrum and Kanban methodologies were prevalent.
* **Knowledge and Execution** > Scrum Masters and Project Managers were the most knowledgeable about Agile; failure to integrate the right people or to teach a team-based culture were the reasons Agile initiatives failed.
* **Benefits** > Project teams that implemented Agile improved their ability to manage changing priorities, increased their productivity, and improved project visibility.
* **Agile Tools** > Project teams used three or four different tools; choices to use specific tools were based on the need for more collaboration, visualization of workflow, collocated/offshore teams, and roll-up metrics across projects/groups.

Three topics of interest extracted from this survey include popularity of practices, top inhibitors to implementing Agile, and Agile tool use preferences:
* **Popularity of Practices** > Agile methodologies used by most projects included Scrum (54 percent) and Scrum/XP Hybrid (11 percent). Agile techniques were numerous, but the top 50 percent used by projects were Daily Standup, Iteration Planning, Unit Testing, Retrospectives, Release Planning, Burndown/Team-Based Estimation, Velocity, Coding Standards, Continuous Integration, Automated Builds, and Dedicated Product Owner.
* **Top Inhibitors** > Barriers that impeded implementation of Agile included the inability to change the organization’s culture, general resistance to change, and the attempt to fit Agile elements into a non-Agile framework.
* **Tool Use and Preferences** > Tools most commonly used by Agile teams included bug trackers, task boards, wikis, spread- sheets, automated build tool, unit test tool, Agile project management tool, and continuous integration tool.
