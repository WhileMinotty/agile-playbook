**Burndown Chart** > Simple, easy-to-understand graphical representation of “Work Remaining” versus “Time Remaining.”

**Continuous Integration** > Practice used by developers to ensure the code repository represents the latest working build of software, including testing and build automation.

**Daily Standup Meeting** > Time-boxed forum used by project teams to communicate progress of Sprint activities.

**Product Backlog** > Prioritized and estimated list of all outstanding product requirements, features, defects, and work items.

**Product Owner** > Person who is primarily responsible for communicating customer requirements.

**Refactoring** > Process used for modifying/revising development code to improve performance, efficiency, readability, and/or simplicity without affecting functionality.

**Relative Estimation** > Software estimation technique that attempts to size development requirements and work items not in terms of time or duration, but rather in terms of size and complexity relative to the size and complexity of other known requirements and work items.

**Scrum** > Incremental, iterative software development framework in which Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and the 
Agile Team members work collaboratively to define Product and Sprint Backlogs that are executed in short, time-boxed events called Sprints.

**Scrum Master** > Person who is primarily responsible for facilitating all Daily Standup Meetings, removing team impediments, protecting teams from external distractions, and keeping the team on track to deliver against the Sprint goals.

**Scrum of Scrums** > Daily communication forum used in larger projects using multiple Agile teams.

**Sprint** > A predefined, time-boxed, and recurring period of time in which working software is created by the Agile Team.

**Sprint Backlog** > A subset of User Stories derived from the Product Backlog containing the planned scope for a given Sprint.

**Sprint Retrospective** > Communication forum used by Agile teams to discuss what can be improved via scheduled meetings at the conclusion of every Sprint.

**Sprint Review** > Review that occurs at the end of a Sprint to provide Agile teams a forum for discussing the status of User Stories (e.g., completed, not completed, deferred, etc.).

**Story Points** > Measures of relative size assigned to requirements for functionality that focus on size and complexity.

**Test-Driven Development(TDD)** > A technique used by Agile teams to build working code and compile tests that show how the code should perform (validating the code).

**Unit Test** > Testing performed by the developer to verify and validate the code.

**User Stories** > Statements created by the Agile Team to capture and communicate the client’s requirements.

**Velocity** > A measure of the number of Story Points an Agile Team can complete within a single, time-boxed Sprint.
