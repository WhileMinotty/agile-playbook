### Fleshing out

#### Failure to launch

> (Added to Teams.md)  **Assuming a class is enough** > While agile education is a core piece of the adoption puzzle, sending a few people (or worse, a single would-be Scrum Master) to a 2- or 3-day certification course is not a recipe for success. In many ways, agile represents a paradigm shift for individals, teams, and leadership.  These entry-level agile certifications simply introduce this new way of thinking and some of the popular frameworks or practices.  They do not equip an individual with the essential change management skills required to achieve sustainable agility.  We employ a team of certified and experienced agile coaches to partner with teams on their journeys towards agility and high-performance.  Read more about creating a coaching capability from Lyssa Adkins (Adkins, 2015).

> (added to Agile at scale) **Lack of an executive sponsor** > The team is enthusiastic about being more collaborative and delivering more value to the end user, but does not see how “management” can help. Or, the management thinks agile is something only the software developers do. Supported by the annual findings in VersionOne’s State of Agile survey (VersionOne, 2016), most barriers to the successful adoption of sustainable agility derive from culture change and support (not just buy-in) from executive level leadership. It is essential to have a leader who understands agile and has the authority to set the vision for its adoption across the organization, program, or team.

#### Agile as chaos

> (added to craftsmanship.md) **No documentation** > Agile is not an excuse to toss out all of your documentation!  The Manifesto simply states "Working software over _comprehensive documentation"_. But, we do emphasize looking at your documentation and understanding its value proposition, just as we do for features we build.  Who is asking for it?  Why are they asking for it?  What will it be used for?  If you are on a team that is not documenting anything, it is worth investigating.

.

> (added to craftsmanship)  **No testing** > If you have a project that seems straight forward or you are very familiar with the technology, it may seem like testing is just going to slow you down.  A key tenet of the Manifesto is "Working software."  Whatever we deliver has to work, and we have to know that it works.  Testing may just confirm what you already know, but is part of technical excellence and a foundation of quality.

.

> (added to Delivery) **No process** >  In environments where we are used to doing work in our own swim lane, or a single person possesses most the knowledge, its easy to skip defining processes,  The team needs to find ways to work together which often take the form of a process.  Repeatable well understood processes for regularly occurring tasks help the team move faster, reduce stress, and integrate new team memebers.  A process needs to be understood by the entire team and perhaps documented for it to work.  The repeatable tasks are often defined during team chartering and revisisted at retrospectives.   Some common processes to reflect on:
- Who checks our work?
- When and how do we deploy our software?
- How do we avoid becoming single threaded on a capability?
- How do we track our work?  Do we need a tool?
- What is our defect tracking process?

.

> (added to Craftsmanship.md) **Poor technical practice** >  Agile does not dictate technical practices, but often it highlights issues that have existed.  Increasing the pace of deployments or automation shows weaknesses in the technical practices through a faster learning cycle, the goal is to decrease time dedicated to defect correction or manual processes that can slow down a team.

#### Lack of rigor

> (added to mearsurement.md) **Extending the sprint** > Often and inevitably, a challenge will arise where extending a single sprint will look like a plausible solution.  And why not?  For decades, we've grown accustomed to sliding schedules "to the right."  Maybe the team did not complete all of the work that they signed up to do, or maybe priorities drastically changed in the middle of the sprint.  Or, even more simply, maybe there is a holiday in the sprint.

> The answer to this question should almost always be _No_.  The team's sprint cadence is an essential piece of their rhythm and predictability. If you're not sure why the sprint is coming up short, that's a good thing to talk about at the retrospective.

.

> (added to Measurement.md) **Taking partial credit** >  Have you ever felt like you're super busy, but you're not getting many things finished? This happens to agile teams, too. It's tempting to quickly start all the current tasks on deck. But, code isn't really valuable until it's running and the user can try it. Since delivering value should be our primary measure of progress, our time is better spent taking things to Done rather than starting more things. Taking partial credit for work does not help the team improve and deliver value.  Inspect why the team is doing this, if there are blockers to completion, those blockers should be addressed rather than starting new work.  

.

> (added to adaptation.md) **Under pressure, so skip the retrospective** >  When a team feels they are behind on work committed, or unexpected issues arise that take their time, its easy to think the retrospective is too long a time committment.  Sometimes you have to slow down to go faster.  The retrospective is an investment in team.  Without the opportunity to reflect in an alloted time, the team will contiue to push aside issues that are affecting their velocity.  The mindset that it is an investment will help the team ultimately become more effective.

.

> (added to craftsmanshio.md) **Not enough attention to quality** > Agile is sometimes only seen as the ability to deliver faster, and that becomes the only focus.  By building in multiple layers of checks and testing, less time correcting defects is needed in the long run.  Build quality check practices into your processes, and look for opportunities to automate them.  This will ensure fewer defects and less time fixing those defects.  The cost of a defect found early in the lifecyle is signifigantly cheaper to fix than those in production.

.

> (added to Craftsmanship.md) **No Definition of Done** > When a team has not established and agreed to a definition of done there can be confusion. Each team member has a differing opinion of what "done" means. Whether it's applied to stories, features, epics, sprint, release, ready for production, etc. the definition of done should be established by the team prior to the work being accomplished. This is usually during team chartering but can be established at anytime prior to planning the work. This level setting across the team means they can hold one another accountable when it comes time to deliver. This also prevents the lingering story that never seems to be done. 
 
 

#### Role confusion

 > (added to teams.md) **Scrum Master is also the Product Owner** >  The Product Owner naturally wants as much value completed in the shortest time to market.  The Scrum Master is there to facilatate the team, help unblock impediments and stay attuned with the team needs. The natural tension that exists with the Scrum Master's and Product Owner's goals help the team find balance.  If they are combined into one person, you lose the benefits of each role.  Either the Product Owner no longer pushes the team to get the most, based on their Scrum Master persona; or the Scrum Master no longer cares about the team's pulse and pushes as the Product Owner.  The team needs both roles.

. 

> (added to Teams.md) **Scrum Master is also the Project Manager** >  The Scrum Master is there to support the team and uphold their process, whereas the Project Manager is there as an interface with the client and keep the project on the rails.  Much like the Product Owner, the Project Manager should be in a natural tension with the Scrum Master.  Managing the work often means tracking resources, budget, risk, tasking, and cross team dependencies, and ensuring delivery on the work committed.  The Scrum Master focuses on the team needs.  By combining these roles, you make both less effective.  The Project Manager taking the Scrum Master stance will put the team first, being less likely to push the team on delivery.  The Scrum Master taking the Project Manager stance would be less likely to protect the team from the outside pressures, and impose less favorable team atmosphere.

#### Resource issues

> (added to teams.md ) **Missing a clear Product Owner** >  Without a clear Product Owner, a cohesive vision for a product is missing. The vision guides the prioritization and understanding of end user value.  Using a panal of stakeholders as a "Product Owner collective" will result in varying opinions and will create confusion in vision and priority.  If a team is in place to hold this role, it is essential to identify who is the ultimate decision owner.

.

> (added to teams.md) **Matrixed resources** > Matrixing resources is common in organizations but can be detimental to the individual and the team cohesion. One key to happy employees is the understanding of responsibilites, priorities and where s/he fits in the grand scheme of the organization. Individuals on teams need to be able to commit his/her time and be fully engaged in the work.  Additionally, one team means one set of priorities.  The cost of context switching between teams or responsibilities means the person will likely be less effective at either one.

#### Culture clash

> (added to teams.md) **People are rewarded for non-agile, non-collaborative behavior** > The hero approach is often applauded by organizations because it shows immediate results and its easy to identify the reason for success.  In the long run it deminishes the importance of tackling issues as a team. When each team member strives to take on everything alone they risk burn out, becoming a bottle neck for the team, and stunted growth of team members. When team members are rewarded for collaborative behavior they build trust, grow skillsets, exchange knowledge, mentor one another, and share responsibility in success and failure.

.

> (added to Teams.md) **Assuming delivery or maintenance are someone else's problem** > So we're back to throwing things over the fence in a "that's not my job" mentality (See generalizing specialist). Not only does this cause tension between teams but it leads to poor quality and just plain "bad stuff." When we don't take responsibility for delivering valuable, quality solutions as a team in the larger sense of the word we short change our customer. 

.

> (added to Teams.md)  **Moving people to work, rather than work to teams** > Management made switches to resources on an organization chart, so the work the team is dispursed and assigned to the new project. Managers should consider how to foster high performing teams.  Teams that work together for a stretch of time begin to find their stride and form an identity. When a team member is moved to "put out fires" on another project the team members left behind must reform. They must establish velocity, revisit working agreements, and begin to normalize around their new composition. This disruption ends up being costly since the receiving team must do the same with the addition of the new team member. When the project needs to increase capacity, the additional stories should be prioritized into the team's backlog instead of moving individuals.

.

> (added to craftsmandship.md) **Security and QA happens at the end** > The security and QA groups aren't on the team, so you exclude them from the sprint plans.  Changing your approach to committing work can sometimes mean bringing in groups who were previously a different department.  Its easy to forget about the QA or security people if they are not actively part of your teams.  Leaving security and QA until the end equates to phases in traditional waterfall. If something is discovered in security or QA the story must go back to the team for rework. At this point the team has already moved onto new stories and must stop to accomplish the rework. The discovery may affect more than one story which results in extra effort to fix the problems. If security and QA can be included throughout the lifecycle, problems can be uncovered early before requiring much rework. This also promotes collaboration and shared committment to security and quality as one team delivering solutions.

.

> (added to Agile at scale) **Assuming resources, time, and scope can all remain fixed** > We're all familiar with the iron triangle of time, resources, and scope. Agile turns it upside down and adjusts scope assuming time and resources are fixed. Time is fixed by using a cadence and resources are usually associated with money which is also fixed during a period of time. By fixing scope as well you're assuming everything is known in advance and the delivery and solution are predictable. This is often not reality. Much of the solution must be discovered through creativity and experimentation. Fixing all three parameters results in date slip, cost overrun, and/or insufficient delivery. There is no room for injecting new, valuable items based on learning and discovery. By allowing the scope to flex and adjust to accomodate changes in the ecosystem or lessons learned through experimentation we shift from being plan focused to being value focused. 

#### Other candidates

> (added to measurement.md)  **Using Velocity to compare across teams** > Throughput and Velocity are unique to every team. Said differently, _you cannot compare teams based on their velocity measures_. Relative estimates are completely dependent on the team that is doing the estimating - one team's 1 might be another team's 5. In practice, we've found that efforts to standardize estimation scales across multiple teams tend to diverge fairly quickly.  Teams should be compared based on the value they are delivering per sprint and the predictability of their delivery.

.

> (added to Craftsmandship) **Collecting data without purpose** > Any data collected should be intentional and with purpose to improve the current process.  Collecting the same data because you always have, is waste.  Review what you do collect and how it improves the system.
