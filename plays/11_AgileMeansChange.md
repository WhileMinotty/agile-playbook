## Agile Often Means Change

"Change. _The Agile Manifesto_ changed the world. It introduced us all to the idea that change can be harnessed and celebrated. It provided us values and principles upon which to stand and from which to build practices that help us keep pace with an ever changing world. It taught us that change is the only constant, and that it should be embraced.

But, it didn’t change the human truth that change is hard, and in the face of constant change, we can be lost, hurt, confused, or left behind.  Change challenges our thinking, our world-view, and our self-view." - _ICAgile Learning Roadmap, Agile Coaching Track_
 
For those adopting agile for the first time -- especially if rooted in years of previous experience and skill -- it can be hard! We are asking people to embrace discovery; value the unfamiliar; trust something intangible. 

Agile coaches and managers are often responsible for bringing and guiding the change, and we want to take this moment to encourage you: there exist the deep disciplines of *change management* and *organizational design* from which to study and draw expertise. Here we will offer just a light brushing of some techniques that you may find useful in your agile adoptions, working through the challenges and frictions you may find.
