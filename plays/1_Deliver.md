> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.


The agile software world uses Scrum extensively. Scrum is an powerful, lightweight product delivery framework that has existed for 25 years. The definitive description of the framework is maintained by its creators in the Scrum Guides.

#Scrum
Scrum was developed with the goal of producing value at a faster, more predictable, and sustainable pace than traditional approaches, all while enabling project teams to adapt more readily to changing requirements.  Refer to the Scrum Guides
Traditionally, projects undergo large amounts of time and effort before the project is released.  In such cases, two distinct processes occur.  First, the product is designed and developed.  Then the product is demonstrated or released to the customer.  Many times, the customer is unhappy with the result and wants changes.  The more fundamental the changes, the more costly.  
Scrum mitigates the cost of changing requirements by incorporating frequent demos and feedback into short development iterations.  Scrum breaks work down into small, understandable, and well-defined requirements.  These requirements are placed into a prioritized list known as the product backlog.  The project is worked in short (usually 2-4 week) iterations known as sprints.  During a sprint, one or more small, self-organized teams (5-9 members) take items off of the product backlog and complete them.  At the end of every sprint, each team demonstrates the working software which they produced during the sprint.  During the demo, the team gathers feedback which will help shape the direction of the next sprint 
Practically, this means that design decisions are not made way ahead of time, but rather right before or even during active development.  Instead of having heavy, top-down design, design emerges and evolves over several iterations—develop, demo, gather feedback, incorporate feedback, develop, demo…

Over the course of several sprints, a picture of progress and direction emerges.  Customers and management are kept informed through progress charts (known as burndowns) and end of sprint-demos.  This process enables customers and product managers to offer near real-time feedback and direction to the project without incurring the high-costs of micromanagement.
If scrum is properly followed, many of the traditional problems associated with complex projects are avoided.  The frequent feedback prevents projects from spending too much time going in the wrong direction.  Furthermore, due to its iterative nature, projects can be terminated early and still deliver a functional, though not ideal, product.

*Scrum Theory*
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.

For example:
- A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,
- Those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common definition of “Done”


*Inspection*

Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.


*Adaptation*

If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation (see Figure 1-2).
Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of the:
 - Sprint Planning
 - Daily Scrum
 - Sprint Review
 - Sprint Retrospective
