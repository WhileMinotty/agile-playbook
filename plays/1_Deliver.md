# Deliver

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

## Play - Start with Scrum

*Start with Scrum for agile delivery, but with an eye for "agility"*

Scrum is the most popular delivery framework for agile teams to use, by far; so much so that it's often confused for "agile" itself. Scrum is a powerful, lightweight product delivery framework that has existed for 25 years. The definitive description of the framework is maintained by its creators in the Scrum Guides (Scrumguides.org). Because the Scrum Guides are such a well-maintained and well-used resource, we won't try to explain everything about Scrum here. 

Scrum was developed with the goal of producing value at a faster, more predictable, and sustainable pace than traditional approaches, all while enabling project teams to adapt more readily to changing requirements.  

Traditionally, projects undergo large amounts of time and effort before the project is released.  In such cases, two distinct processes occur.  First, the product is designed and developed.  Then the product is demonstrated or released to the customer.  Many times, the customer is unhappy with the result and wants changes.  The more fundamental the changes, the more costly.

Scrum mitigates the cost of changing requirements by incorporating frequent demos and feedback into short development iterations.  Scrum breaks work down into small, understandable, prioritized requirements. 
The project is worked in short (usually 2-4 week) iterations known as sprints.  During a sprint, the delivery team chooses what high-value work it can complete; and the team focuses on just that work for the sprint's duration. At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the working software which they produced.  During the demo, the team gathers feedback which will help shape the direction of the product going forward.

Practically, this means that design decisions are not made way ahead of time, but rather right before or even during active development.  Instead of having heavy, top-down design, design emerges and evolves over several iterations: develop, demo, gather feedback, incorporate feedback, develop, demoâ€¦

Over the course of several sprints, a picture of progress and direction emerges.  Customers and management are kept informed through progress charts and end of sprint-demos.  It becomes easy to keep everyone informed, while avoiding many pitfalls of micromanagement.

If Scrum is followed, many of the traditional problems associated with complex projects are avoided.  The frequent feedback prevents projects from spending too much time going in the wrong direction.  Furthermore, due to its iterative nature, projects can be terminated early and still deliver a functional, though not ideal, product.

Iteration -- trying something; looking at it -- is core to how Scrum operates. Scrum is built on three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

#### Transparency
Many of the challenges teams face boil down to communications issues. Scrum values keeping communication and progress out in the open; doing things as a team; being transparent. 
The fact that Scrum's ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily standup, Sprint Review, and Retrospective) are intended for the whole team speaks to the importance of transparency. 

#### Inspection
Inspecting things is how we know if they're working. Everything on a Scrum team is open to inspection. 

#### Adaptation
As we inspect things, if we would benefit from doing it differently, let's try it! We can always adjust again later. Notably, Scrum's Sprint Review ceremony gives us an explicit, regular opportunity to adapt based on how the product is coming along; the Retrospective does the same for how our team is working.



## Play - Seeing success but need more flexibility? Move on to Scrumban

*If Scrum is too restrictive or there are too many changing priorities within a sprint, consider Scrumban to provide the structure of ceremonies with flexibility of delivery.*

Scrumban is derived from Scrum and Kanban (described below) as the name would suggest.  It keeps the underlying Scrum ceremonies, while introducing the flow theory of Kanban.  

Scrumban was developed in 2009 by Corey Ladas to move teams from Scrum which is a good starting point in agile, to Kanban, which enables flow for delivery on demand.  
Kanban focuses on flow, but it does not have prescribed meetings and roles -- so we borrow those from Scrum in this Scrumban model. 
The primary difference versus Scrum is that the sprint timebox no longer applies to delivery. Instead, a work-in-progress limit (WIP limit) is set to enable team members to pull work on demand, 
but not so many things that they have trouble finishing the work at hand. Scrumban has evolved some of its own practices.  

Examples of unique practices to Scrumban include:
 - *Bucket size planning* was developed to enable long-term planning where a work item goes from the idea bucket, to a goal bucket, then to the story bucket.  The story bucket holds items ready to be considered during an on demand planning session.
 - *On demand planning* This practice moves away from planing on a regular cadence, instead only holding planning sessions when more work is needed.  Items to be pulled into the Kanban board are prioritized and finalized and added to the Kanban board.
 - *Cycle time* Is a metric captured to measure the time it takes from task creation or beginning work to completion.  Because items on pulled when ready to work, it allows examination of common impediments or elaboration issues that disrupt the flow.

## Play - If you are ready to kick off the training wheels, try Kanban
*Try Kanban on only the most disciplined teams and when throughput is paramount*

Kanban is a framework adopted from industrial engineering.  It was developed to be mindful of organizational change management which is apparent in the four original principles:
- Start with existing process
- Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
- Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and title
- Leadership at all levels

So, in Kanban, you will not (inherently) be receiving a bunch of new titles, or using much new vocabulary.

In 2010 David Anderson elaborated with four "Open Kanban" practices tailored for software delivery:
- Visualize the workflow
- Limit WIP
- Manage Flow
- Make Process Policies Explicit
- Improve Collaboratively (using models & the scientific method)

In Kanban, you fundamentally want to make all of your work visible, continuously prioritize it, and always be flowing things to Done. This is great for a software team that issues several new releases per week, or per day. 
A pitfall, however, is that if priorities are allowed to change too often, no work will ever get done. So be mindful about finishing things, and not starting too many things.

Kanban is appropriate for teams ready to self regulate, rather than rely on timeboxes. The practices require discipline to enable flow.
