## Value 

Most software has more features than necessary (Cite CHAOS stude 2002?). Agile teams emphasize prioritizing features by the value they bring to real users and stakeholders. Considering the value of things is just as important as delivering working software, since time spent on non-valuable features is wasted time. 

### Play: Share a vision inside and outside your team

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

The vision is the foundation upon which product decisions are made. When at critical junctures, turn to the vision to help determine which direction will help the vision become a material reality. At the team and individual levels, the vision provides a common mission to rally around and helps understand the long-term goals, as well as incremental goals.

#### Practice: Product Vision Statement
The vision for the project should be encapsulated in a product vision statement created by the Product Owner. Akin to an “elevator pitch” or quick summary, the goal of the product vision statement is to communicate the value that the software will add to the organization. It should be clear and direct enough to be understood by every level of the effort, including project stakeholders. The Vision Board by Roman Pichler is a nice, simple template for forming this statement [Pichler Consulting 2016].

#### Practice: Product box
The product box is another way to try to crack into the product’s vision. You might try this exercise as an alternative to working with the Vision Board. The product box is a great way to engage a whole team in the conversation around the vision and value of the project at hand, and to have some fun together while doing so. While there are many versions of this idea, Innovation Games is a well-known one. As described there, “\[Ask your stakeholders\] to imagine that they’re selling your product at a tradeshow, retail outlet, or public market. Give them a few cardboard boxes and ask them to literally design a product box that they would buy. The box should have the key marketing slogans that they find interesting” \[Innovation Games 2015\]. We have also seen this work nicely by imagining that your product is appearing in the App Store; what would the description, icon, screenshots, and reviews look like?


#### Practice: Product roadmap
Most teams need a *product roadmap* to understand high-level objectives and direction for the project. We think of this as the project’s North Star. If we’ve deviated distinctly from it, we should have a good reason, and we probably need to update the roadmap. Be sure to include the ultimate project goals in the roadmap, keeping in mind their value added and the desired outcomes from the customer’s point of view. The roadmap should loosely encapsulate the overall vision and give a sense for when capabilities will be delivered or intersecting milestones are going to occur. The roadmap should probably cover the next 6–12 months, and only in broad strokes. On the roadmap, releases contain less detail the farther they are into the future.   Your team will have to talk through rough sizing of work and prioritization during the creation process. **You’re not building a schedule**; you’re trying to paint a *plausible* picture. Be sure to build this together as a team, or at least review and revise it together. Too many roadmaps are built by leadership and never have buy-in from the team.

#### Practice: Release plan
Once the roadmap is complete, a *release plan* may be created for the first release. Each release should begin with the creation of a release plan specific to the goals and priorities for that release. This plan ensures that the value being added to the project is consistently reviewed and, if necessary, realigned to maximize the overall value and efficiency of development. Like the product roadmap, the release plan should include a high-level timeline of the progression of development, specific to the priorities for that release only. The highest value items should be released first, allowing the stakeholders visibility into the progression of the work.


### Play: Backlogs—Turn vision into action

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Once we have and share our vision, we understand the big stuff, but we have to turn this to action quickly. A core practice for agile teams is to have a *backlog* of work. In this context, a backlog is a prioritized set of all the desired work (that we know about) we want to do on the project. 

#### Backlog basics
Treat your backlog as a “catch all”; any item that moves the team ahead to a final product or project goal can be added to your backlog. New features, defects, abandoned refactoring, meetings, and other work are all game to be placed there. Additionally, keep in mind that your backlog will evolve in detail and priority through engagement with the end user. Your backlog should be a living, breathing testament to your product, as you will iteratively refine your backlog as your build your product. Product backlog items are added and refined until all valuable features of that product are delivered, which may occur through multiple releases during the project lifecycle. 

#### Backlog creation
A backlog is made of epics and user stories. User stories are simply something a user wants, and they're sized such that we understand them well; epics are bigger than that and we need to break them down further such that the team can actually execute. Generally, anyone can add something to the backlog, but the Product Owner “owns” that backlog overall—setting the priority of things and deciding what we really should be working on next.

Good backlogs follow the acronym DEEP:

* **Detailed.** The backlog should be detailed enough so that everyone understands the need (not just the person who wrote it).
* **Estimated.** The user story should be sufficient for the delivery team to provide an estimated effort for implementing it. (Stories near the top of the product backlog can be estimated more accurately than those near the bottom.)
* **Emergent.** The product backlog should contain those stories that are considered emergent—reflecting current, pressing, or realistic needs.
* **Prioritized.** The product backlog should be prioritized so everyone understands which stories are most important now and require implementation soon.

We dive further into both epics and user stories in the following play.

#### Practice: Product and sprint backlogs
A *product backlog* is a prioritized list of product requirements (probably called user stories), regularly maintained, prioritized, and estimated using a scale based on story points. It represents all of the work we may want to do for the project, and it changes often. We have not committed to deliver the full scope captured in the product backlog.

A *sprint backlog* is a detailed list of all the work we’ve committed to doing in the current sprint—just a few weeks of work. Once we set it up in sprint planning, it remains locked for the duration of the sprint. No new (surprise!) work should be added. The whole team should keep it up to date by (at least daily), and items should be marked complete based on the team’s agreed Definition of Done.



### Play: Build for and get feedback from real users

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

##### Design Thinking
Design Thinking is a human-centered innovation methodology that focuses on discovering people’s unmet needs, identifying insights, understanding the customer journey, reframing problems, and inspiring new ideas to improve a human experience. Design Thinking is especially helpful for “complex” problems that require discovery and learning where by prototyping and adjusting, better solutions are revealed. 

Some Design Thinking behaviors your team could try:

+ Be curious and patient, actively prototype to get information out there as fast as possible so you can iterate, adjust, pivot, and retest
+ Be empathic to understand the challenges and environment of your users
+ Be open minded to viewing things from a new perspective
+ Be comfortable with exploring, failing, experimenting, and learning so you can address the right problems for the users
+ Be collaborative, trust your teammates, share experiences, and explore different ideas even if they are conflicting and build on one another’s ideas

#### Practice: Define personas 
Personas are fictitious people who represent the needs of your users, and they help us understand if our work is going to be valuable for the people we’re trying to reach. They can be very useful at the start of the requirements gathering process, but typically remain important throughout.

Each persona should capture the user and their individual needs. Create a template with an area to draw a picture of the user and separate spaces to describe the user personally, but also describe their desired goals, use cases, and desires for the software.

![Persona Template](https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton/agile-playbook/raw/master/graphics/persona_template.jpg)


#### Practice: Talk with users about needs, not solutions 
Consider the difference between “I want the software to have one button for each department in my business” and “I need to be able to access each department in my business from the software.”

Users often think they know exactly what they want to see, but we find it can be much more effective if we understand the needs and then exercise creativity in how to provide a delightful experience that satisfies that need.

As you can, guide your users into conversations of value and need, and let the delivery team work through the solution.


#### Practice: Epics and user stories

##### A template for User Stories and Epics

Epics and user stories are described below, but both share a typical template:

* Title (Short)
* Value statement
    * Outlines and communicates the work to be completed and what value delivering this epic or story will bring to a specific persona/user
    * Format: As a (user role/persona) I need (some capability), so that (some value)
* Acceptance criteria 
    * An outlined list of granular criteria that must be met in order for the story or epic to be fully delivered and adequately tested and verified. This helps inform development and understanding of when the story is ready to demonstrate or test further.


##### User Stories 
User Stories are the agile response to requirements, and you can call them requirements if you like. 

They often look like this:

* As a solo traveler
* I want to safely discover other travelers who are traveling alone
* So I can meet possible companions on my next trip.

There are a few things that are different about user stories versus typical requirements.

* They are communicated in terms of value, from the user perspective.
* They might look a little lightweight at first. We agree we need to *tell stories*—we know there are details that can only be sussed out through collaborating with our users and stakeholders. We understand that what is written down is imperfect. What we want to do is capture enough to get started!

The Product Owner collaborates with the delivery team to develop user stories that will mold the product’s functionality. User stories are identified and prepared throughout the project’s lifecycle.

There are two devices we typically use to describe good user stories: the three Cs and INVEST.

##### The three Cs
* **Card.** This is the description of the user story itself, written on a card or in a tracking tool. The card should give us enough detail to get started and know whom to talk to.
* **Conversation.** We acknowledge that anyone implementing needs to—and should—speak with some of the players involved in the value that story will deliver. So they need to go have a conversation and record anything that needs to be preserved from that conversation.
* **Confirmation.** Once implemented, every user story needs to be verified. We call this the Confirmation. And we should record in the user story how we intend to verify it. This could be the list of acceptance criteria, test plans, and so on.

##### INVEST

A way to see if your user stories are pretty good is to consider the INVEST acronym.
 
* **I - Independent.** Stories should be as independent as possible, so they can be implemented out of order.
* **N - Negotiable.** We should be able to discuss the details of the user story, find the optimal solution, and not treat the initial writing as gospel.
* **V - Valuable.** A story must deliver value to the user or customer when complete.
* **E - Estimable.** Stories should be such that we can estimate their effort.
* **S - Small.** User stories should be small enough to prioritize, work on, and test. For teams using sprints, user stories should be able to be completed inside one sprint.
* **T - Testable.** We should know how to verify and test the story.


##### Epics
Epics are broad functionalities we want our product to deliver. They are larger than user stories. Epics would typically take multiple sprints to deliver, and would ultimately be broken down into many user stories. You can still write epics like user stories, and the guidelines above typically apply, with the exception of Small and Estimable.


##### Strong v. weak user stories

| Strong User Stories Are...                                        | Weak User Stories Are… | 
| ----------------------------                                      | -------------------------- |
| Developed and prioritized by the Product Owner                    | Created with limited Product Owner involvement | 
| Written from the user’s perspective | Developed without designating the specific user or user group that will receive value from the story |
| Simple and concise, with clear alignment to business value        | Missing a description of the business value |
| Entry points to a conversation on how the implementation activities can be decomposed | Technical specifications that don’t link to the user’s point of view |
| Written with easy-to-understand acceptance criteria                | Open ended with no means to validate acceptance |
