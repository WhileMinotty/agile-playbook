## Teams

Agile teams are where the work gets done. Team members care about each other, their work, and their stakeholders. And agile teams are constantly stretching, reaching for high performance. 

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


### Play: Organize as Scrum teams
Agile teams are cross-functional in nature and work together to analyze, design, and build the solution their customers need. Agile team members, together, can understand the business or mission needs and create an effective solution that meets those needs. We use one particular set of vocabulary here for this playbook, which is reflective of some of the most common terms found across government and industry; but, individual client environments may dictate different names for things. We stress that the jobs and structures mentioned here are helpful in any context, and we urge teams to strive for the greatest agility possible, then seek to continuously improve through small changes.

#### Practice: Build the Scrum team
Scrum gives us a simple model for a team, and we believe this is a valuable frame for most agile teams. Scrum suggests just three roles:

- Scrum Master 
- Product Owner
- Team Member

##### The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is an experienced agilist, responsible for upholding agile values and principles for the delivery effort. The Scrum Master helps the team execute its agreed-upon delivery process and typically facilitates common team ceremonies, like daily standup meetings, planning meetings, demos, retrospectives, and so on. The Scrum Master biases the team toward action and delivery and stretches the team to continuously improve, hold each other accountable, and take ownership of the way the process works.

Although Scrum is a specific agile framework, (explained more in the Delivery section), the notion of a delivery team facilitator in an agile team is so common and so effective, we feel it’s simplest to refer to this person as a Scrum Master—even for a non-Scrum team—given it is the most common term for that role.

Scrum Masters typically:

1. Make sure the right people are talking together, all the time
2. Remove barriers for the team ​
3. Reflect progress back to the team
4. Shield the team from interruptions
5. Ensure the team's process is followed, including facilitating team ceremonies
6. Coach and mentor the team and customers on living out agile values and principles
7. Tune into team morale, energy, and conflict and address issues 
8. Ensure the team has an environment that fosters productivity, openness, and teamwork​

###### Growing Scrum Masters

We routinely encounter clients and teams who place more stock in entry-level certifications, like [Certified Scrum Master](https://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/certified-scrummaster-csm), than is truly warranted.  While this certification and others like it provide a great overview of the Scrum framework, it does not magically make someone an effective Scrum Master.  Because of this, we recommend the following learning plan for our Scrum Masters:

| Core or Elective | Certification | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | ICP | ICAgile Certified Professional |
| Core | PSM I | Professional Scrum Master I |
| Core | ICP-ATF | ICAgile Certified Professional in Agile Team Facilitation |
| Elective | PMI-ACP | PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner |
| Elective | ICP-ACC | ICAgile Certified Professional in Agile Coaching |
| Elective | SA | SAFe Agilist |
​

##### The Product Owner
The Product Owner is the person who most considers the mission or business value of the solution being developed. They are responsible for maximizing the return on investment for the development effort, and they speak for the interests of the users. They could be from the client organization; if they are from the Booz Allen team, they represent the client’s perspective. They interact regularly with the delivery team, clarifying needs and providing feedback on designs, prototypes, and iterations of the solution. 

> **Anti-Pattern - Assuming a class is enough** > While agile education is a core piece of the adoption puzzle, sending a few people (or worse, a single would-be Scrum Master) to a 2- or 3-day certification course is not a recipe for success. In many ways, agile represents a paradigm shift for individals, teams, and leadership.  These entry-level agile certifications simply introduce this new way of thinking and some of the popular frameworks or practices.  They do not equip an individual with the essential change management skills required to achieve sustainable agility.  We employ a team of certified and experienced agile coaches to partner with teams on their journeys towards agility and high-performance.  Read more about creating a coaching capability from Lyssa Adkins (Adkins, 2015).

Product Owners typically:

1. Create and maintain the product backlog
2. Prioritize and sequence the backlog according to business value
3. Assist with elaboration of epics into user stories that are granular enough to be completed soon (like a single sprint)
4. Convey the vision and goals for the project, for every release, and for every sprint
5. Represent and engage the customer
6. Participate in regular team ceremonies (like standups, planning, reviews, retrospectives)
7. Inspect progress every sprint, accept or reject work, and explain why
8. Steer the team’s direction at sprint boundaries
9. Communicate status externally
10. Terminate a sprint when drastic change is required

###### Growing Product Owners

We use the following learning plan to grow Product Owners and agile business analysts:

| Core or Elective | Certification | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | ICP | ICAgile Certified Professional |
| Core | PSPO I | Professional Scrum Product Owner I |
| Core | ICP-BVA | ICAgile Certified Professional in Business Value Analysis |
| Elective | PMI-ACP | PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner |
| Elective | ICP-ATF | ICAgile Certified Professional in Agile Team Facilitation |
| Elective | SPM/PO | SAFe Product Manager/Product Owner |


##### The team member
Team members are, of course, the other members of the team, such as testers, developers, and designers. They are the people who, collectively, work together to deliver value on the project. They carry a diverse set of skills and expertise, but they are happy to help out in areas that are not their specialty. Team members, together, take collective responsibility for the total solution, rather than having a “just my job” outlook. Team members do whatever they can to help the team meet its sprint goal and build a successful product.

#### On functional roles and T-shaped people
On agile teams, there should be less emphasis on being a “tester” or a “business analyst” or a “developer”; we should be working together, sharing the load, collectively getting to the goal. That said, we still value the specialties and disciplines our team members bring to the project. Agile teams are ideally made of **generalizing specialists**, sometimes referred to as **T-shaped people**, who collaborate across skill sets but bring valuable depth in a useful specialty to the project. This means that while a team member may have deep knowledge in a particular area, known as a specialist, they also need to build knowledge broadly, known as a generalist.

The “T” in T-shaped is made up of a vertical line representing the deep knowledge of a specialist and a horizontal line representing the broad knowledge of a generalist. Specialists who are deep but not broad can only accomplish work in a particular area and can become a bottleneck when they are the only team member who can accomplish the work. Conversely, generalists who have broad but not deep knowledge can become a bottleneck when the work requires a deeper understanding or greater skill set. Teams of generalizing specialists build trust in one another by collectively committing to goals, sharing knowledge, actively mentoring, and delivering solutions.

> **Anti-Pattern - Assuming delivery or maintenance are someone else's problem** > So we're back to throwing things over the fence in a "that's not my job" mentality (See generalizing specialist). Not only does this cause tension between teams but it leads to poor quality and just plain "bad stuff." When we don't take responsibility for delivering valuable, quality solutions as a team in the larger sense of the word we short change our customer. 

On bigger teams, it’s reasonable that people may live in their specialty more than on a smaller team. Team composition is heavily influenced by financial feasibility.  Teams working for a client under contract often have constraints related to a labor category and hourly rate.  This is the perfect opportunity to bring junior members along, and encourage learning skills outside the specialty as needed.  For example a junior developer may benefit from learning test automation, which is adjacent to development.  Constraints on skill sets or level are the perfect opportunity to emphasize the need for teams with T-shaped members.  Ultimately this is a balance that the team, with all its local context, should talk about and adapt through inspection and conversation.

#### On team size
Our experience shows that a cross-functional team of less than 10 is the preferred team size. This is supported by the  Project Management Institute and generally follows the Scrum Guides. This size would include a dedicated Scrum Master and a Product Owner. As the project size scales beyond 10, the effectiveness of the team per person declines, and significantly more time is spent coordinating work. If the scale of the work requires a large team, we need to think about how that can be divided into multiple cross-functional teams that are tightly coordinated but loosely coupled.

More thoughts on scale can be found in the Agile at Scale section.

#### Team structure patterns
In its simplest frame, agile teams have people who focus on the value of things—what needs to be built—and other folks focused on the delivery of things—how we will build it, what’s possible. Though they operate as a single team with one goal and one purpose, you can also consider that there are two virtual, smaller teams here: a value team and a delivery team. There are a few patterns we see work well, so we explain those in the next three plays.

 > **Anti-Pattern - Scrum Master is also the Product Owner** >  The Product Owner naturally wants as much value completed in the shortest time to market.  The Scrum Master is there to facilatate the team, help unblock impediments and stay attuned with the team needs. The natural tension that exists with the Scrum Master's and Product Owner's goals help the team find balance.  If they are combined into one person, you lose the benefits of each role.  Either the Product Owner no longer pushes the team to get the most, based on their Scrum Master persona; or the Scrum Master no longer cares about the team's pulse and pushes as the Product Owner.  The team needs both roles.


### Play: Expand to a value team when one Product Owner isn't enough
If the mission needs are sufficiently complex or there are complicated relationships with multiple client stakeholders, it might be impossible to have just one Product Owner. In that case, we recommend thinking of a larger value team. This team might grow to around 10 people and would typically include representatives like business analysts, compliance interests, end users, and so on. In this case, there can still be a Product Owner, but that person is now the value team’s facilitator, bringing together all those perspectives and creating a common voice, and typically would not be able to trump the other stakeholders. In this setting, the jobs of the Scrum Master and Product Owner become more difficult—trying to coordinate all the interests at play—but they can still be very successful.

> **Scrum Master is also the Project Manager** >  The Scrum Master is there to support the team and uphold their process, whereas the Project Manager is there as an interface with the client and keep the project on the rails.  Much like the Product Owner, the Project Manager should be in a natural tension with the Scrum Master.  Managing the work often means tracking resources, budget, risk, tasking, and cross team dependencies, and ensuring delivery on the work committed.  The Scrum Master focuses on the team needs.  By combining these roles, you make both less effective.  The Project Manager taking the Scrum Master stance will put the team first, being less likely to push the team on delivery.  The Scrum Master taking the Project Manager stance would be less likely to protect the team from the outside pressures, and impose less favorable team atmosphere.

### Play: Scale to multiple delivery teams and value teams when needed
If the overall solution scope is very large, the expertise required is sufficiently diverse, or the timeline is constrained such that a single team is insufficient to produce the solution, then you’ll have to scale up to multiple delivery teams, each with its own Product Owner/value team. There are a few frameworks that help in scaling agile, which we discuss later in this Playbook. Additional roles are likely required, like architects to keep the technology sufficiently robust and coordinated.

> **Anti-Pattern - People are rewarded for non-agile, non-collaborative behavior** > The hero approach is often applauded by organizations because it shows immediate results and its easy to identify the reason for success.  In the long run it deminishes the importance of tackling issues as a team. When each team member strives to take on everything alone they risk burn out, becoming a bottle neck for the team, and stunted growth of team members. When team members are rewarded for collaborative behavior they build trust, grow skillsets, exchange knowledge, mentor one another, and share responsibility in success and failure.

### Play: Invite security into the team

The security perspective needs to be ever present in the process; not just an after-thought.  From establishing requirements, through designing the system and implementing features, to operations and sustainment, security needs to be considered and baked-in.  In a modern team, it is everyone’s responsibility to think about, address, and implement secure practices. Security should be embedded in the culture; it isn't just a step at the end, or "that other team" down the hall. It will typically make sense for security-focused professionals to find their home in the Value Team, when we think about how the software may need to attain a certain accreditation or certification. But, security-mindedness is essential for the delivery team as well, because we want those practices and habits which build secure software to be part of the routine work.

### Play: Build a cohesive team
We strongly believe in keeping the team together. And the simplest team is under 10 people, has a dedicated single Product Owner, and has a dedicated single Scrum Master. This team is committed to just one project at a time and can plan and estimate together. The longer a team is together, it tends to be more predictable, has great potential for high-performance, and really enjoys working together.

> **Anti-Pattern - Moving people to work, rather than work to teams** > Management made switches to resources on an organization chart, so the work the team is dispursed and assigned to the new project. Managers should consider how to foster high performing teams.  Teams that work together for a stretch of time begin to find their stride and form an identity. When a team member is moved to "put out fires" on another project the team members left behind must reform. They must establish velocity, revisit working agreements, and begin to normalize around their new composition. This disruption ends up being costly since the receiving team must do the same with the addition of the new team member. When the project needs to increase capacity, the additional stories should be prioritized into the team's backlog instead of moving individuals.

#### Practice: Chartering
At the beginning of a project, or after significant change on a project (in scope or in team makeup), we recommend team chartering. This is a meeting, ideally in person, together—even for a team that’s otherwise distributed. And the real focus of this meeting is: Who are we, and what are we doing? We recommend working through activities to get to know each other and find out what each member’s skills and passions are. How do you like to have fun? How do you like to communicate? What makes you happy? What makes you frustrated? You’ll likely want a good facilitator to pull this chartering meeting together. Teams find it has lasting effects on the sense of community, empathy for each other, and overall effectiveness.

> **Anti-Pattern - Matrixed resources** > Matrixing resources is common in organizations but can be detimental to the individual and the team cohesion. One key to happy employees is the understanding of responsibilites, priorities and where s/he fits in the grand scheme of the organization. Individuals on teams need to be able to commit his/her time and be fully engaged in the work.  Additionally, one team means one set of priorities.  The cost of context switching between teams or responsibilities means the person will likely be less effective at either one.

#### Practice: Colocate

##### Colocation is still best
We still recommend colocating agile teams as much as possible. Being together in one room, or in close proximity, allows a lot of things that are much tougher otherwise: You can pull together an impromptu meeting or demo more easily. You can put an idea on a whiteboard, or tape up some designs on the wall and get feedback quickly. And there’s no substitute for hearing your teammates’ sighs, squeals, and applause, signaling you to what’s happening on the project right this moment. Our brains have evolved to communicate with much more than words, and seeing each other’s faces is just as important as the language being used.

A great team room contains a few things: 

- Comfortable workspaces for each team member
- Enough space to move around and pair with another team member at their desk
- Information radiators on the walls that reflect project status and monitoring
- A comfortable space to lounge and be social or to use for meetings
- A private space for team members to conduct sensitive conversations or high-concentration work

#### Practice: Distribute with intent

##### Distribution can work
Colocation isn’t always possible. For lots of different reasons, we may lean to distributed teams: availability of talent, cost, client geographies, and so on. We might be fully distributed, or just have a few team members in satellite locations. When we are distributed, we have to put in extra effort to stay communicative and engaged with each other, and every common team meeting requires more work from the facilitators. Planning meetings, standups, retrospectives—distribution complicates how we collaborate for all of them. Clearly, technology plays a role here to keep us together—tools like chat, video, electronic whiteboards. If your team is distributed, you need to approach this intentionally; fewer good things will happen by accident than what we see in colocated teams. 

We have a few tips that can help distributed teams: 

* **Use video.** Make sure each team member, regardless of location, has a camera, and create a virtual team room by having everyone on camera all the time. This way, when speaking on the phone or chatting via IM, we still get to see facial expressions.
* **Get off email.** Consider banning email for communication inside your team. Emails are easy to lose, and waiting for email responses slows teams down. Use the phone more, and get a persistent chat room tool for your team.
* **Facilitate from the lowest-bandwidth perspective.** If you need to lead a meeting, and four people will be in a conference room together and two will be attending via Skype, then you should get on Skype and conduct the meeting from another room, treating each person as remote. This ensures no one is overlooked.
* **Talk about it.** There’s no substitute for regularly asking each other how things are going, and if we can improve. As time goes on, you’ll need different rhythms, different tools, or just to express what’s frustrating you about the way we work. Create space for those conversations. Distribution can be tough, but there are many teams that do it well, and it unlocks a certain freedom that those team members really enjoy.
