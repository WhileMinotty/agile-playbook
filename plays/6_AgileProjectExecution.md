# Agile Project Execution

*Project management is the discipline of completing specific work within specific parameters. But you don’t want to use the same process you use to build an airplane to build software!*

Traditional project management works well for highly stable, low discovery work. 

We have learned this approach does not work well for highly changing, high-discovery work such as software development.

Project execution for Agile projects has adapted to better deal with the complexity of software and other similar types projects.

Figure 1 shows the traditional Project Management Process Groups and how they are modified in an Agile environment. One key difference is the opportunity for feedback and learning during execution, rather than a linear path based only on the original plan.

Traditional project management for software delivery is often referred to as a “waterfall” approach where each step occurs sequentially one at a time. Project Management Institute (PMI) organizes its process by into five groups seen in Figure 1.

Here are some of the similarities and differences between traditional waterfall project management and managing Agile projects:

#### Similarities

+ You start with an idea and plan, then execute, and close when finished.

+ You pay close attention to details during the execution process.

+ Agile project management is still project management. In the end, you are still in the same environment working with the same constraints.

#### Differences

+ With Agile project management, your initial planning is less rigid: The roadmap has only enough vision to show direction.

+ With Agile PM, executing involves a continuous learning loop of obtaining feedback from the customer and adjusting—not just monitoring and controlling.

+ With Agile PM, teams reflect and are given space to improve within the period of performance. 

Figure 2 shows the typical project management knowledge areas and how they are modified in an Agile environment. This diagram is meant to show mindset differences—not meant to be binary (black or white). Reality is usually a spectrum or a continuum where you use agility as warranted for the specific project.

#### Similarities

+ You are still dealing with the same knowledge areas.

####Differences

+ Agile project management focuses on prototyping, learning, team building, etc.

### Play: Make your Project Management Office more agile

The Project Management Office (PMO) has traditionally been used to manage cost and risk across a portfolio of projects in an organization. It’s time to reimagine how the PMO can help organizations now that the pace of work has changed and work is moving toward a more Agile, cadencebased management and away from the more traditional, schedule-driven delivery mindset. Whether you are a PMO that helps Agile teams, or you are interested in getting your organization started in Agile methods, you can benefit from these five ways your PMO can make your entire organization more agile.

1. **Lead the way toward agility:** PMOs are usually the keeper of processes and finding efficiencies across projects. According to the 2017 VersionOne “State of Agile Report,” 94 percent of organizations are using Agile methods. Whether it is with software development or other areas of the organization, it’s time for PMOs to be the experts on agility! Successful PMOs in Agile organizations have Agile coaches and practices they propagate throughout the projects to help them get the boost they need to improve and find new efficiencies.

2. **Become more of a Project Support Office (PSO) rather than a management office:** The command and control mindset of traditional project management demanded just that— management! When projects move to an Agile mindset, they need practices to help them manage their scope and delivery through the product owner role and cadence (sprints or iterations). The new model of a PSO should help projects focus on value delivery rather than be burdened by overbearing financial reporting demands.

3. **Create a “pull rather than push” system:** With demand for delivery, companies are constantly pushing demands to projects, stunting their ability to innovate or focus on quality. The PMO can relieve that pressure by creating a pull system from the project, rather than another source of demands. Pulling reports and information needed on a cadence or available on demand via dynamic dashboards, relieves the projects from the constant pressure to provide status reports.

4. **Automate reporting to support the pull system:** Just as we need automation in software development to enable flow and reduce repetitive tasks, we need that focus on reporting to take the burden off the teams where before they would create materials used only for one-time status reporting. The technology exists to automate; we need to think of innovation in reporting just as important as other technical innovation.

5. **PMO is an agile team:** Just as the Agile projects are constantly trying to improve, the PMO needs to grow beyond relying on “best practices” to an innovate-and-improve mindset. An Agile team reflects and acts on improvements, and the PMO is a team who can do that same. With continual attention to improving the support to projects, the overall organization will become more agile and responsive.
