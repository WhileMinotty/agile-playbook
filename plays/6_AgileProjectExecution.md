## Agile Project Execution

*Project management is the discipline of completing specific work within specific parameters. But you don’t want to use the same process you use to build an airplane to build software!*

Traditional project management works well for highly stable, low discovery work. 

We have learned this approach does not work well for highly changing, high-discovery work such as software development.

Project execution for Agile projects has adapted to better deal with the complexity of software and other similar types projects.

Figure 1 shows the traditional Project Management Process Groups and how they are modified in an Agile environment. One key difference is the opportunity for feedback and learning during execution, rather than a linear path based only on the original plan.

Traditional project management for software delivery is often referred to as a “waterfall” approach where each step occurs sequentially one at a time. Project Management Institute (PMI) organizes its process by into five groups seen in Figure 1.

Here are some of the similarities and differences between traditional waterfall project management and managing Agile projects:

#### Similarities

+ You start with an idea and plan, then execute, and close when finished.

+ You pay close attention to details during the execution process.

+ Agile project management is still project management. In the end, you are still in the same environment working with the same constraints.

#### Differences

+ With Agile project management, your initial planning is less rigid: The roadmap has only enough vision to show direction.

+ With Agile PM, executing involves a continuous learning loop of obtaining feedback from the customer and adjusting—not just monitoring and controlling.

+ With Agile PM, teams reflect and are given space to improve within the period of performance. 


Figure 2 shows the typical project management knowledge areas and how they are modified in an Agile environment. This diagram is meant to show mindset differences—not meant to be binary (black or white). Reality is usually a spectrum or a continuum where you use agility as warranted for the specific project.

#### Similarities

+ You are still dealing with the same knowledge areas.

#### Differences

+ Agile project management focuses on prototyping, learning, team building, etc.

### Play: Make your Project Management Office more agile

The Project Management Office (PMO) has traditionally been used to manage cost and risk across a portfolio of projects in an organization. It’s time to reimagine how the PMO can help organizations now that the pace of work has changed and work is moving toward a more Agile, cadencebased management and away from the more traditional, schedule-driven delivery mindset. Whether you are a PMO that helps Agile teams, or you are interested in getting your organization started in Agile methods, you can benefit from these five ways your PMO can make your entire organization more agile.

#### Practice: Lead the way toward agility

PMOs are usually the keeper of processes and finding efficiencies across projects. According to the 2017 VersionOne “State of Agile Report,” 94 percent of organizations are using Agile methods. Whether it is with software development or other areas of the organization, it’s time for PMOs to be the experts on agility! Successful PMOs in Agile organizations have Agile coaches and practices they propagate throughout the projects to help them get the boost they need to improve and find new efficiencies.

#### Practice: Become more of a Project Support Office (PSO) rather than a management office

The command and control mindset of traditional project management demanded just that— management! When projects move to an Agile mindset, they need practices to help them manage their scope and delivery through the product owner role and cadence (sprints or iterations). The new model of a PSO should help projects focus on value delivery rather than be burdened by overbearing financial reporting demands.

#### Practice: Create a “pull rather than push” system

With demand for delivery, companies are constantly pushing demands to projects, stunting their ability to innovate or focus on quality. The PMO can relieve that pressure by creating a pull system from the project, rather than another source of demands. Pulling reports and information needed on a cadence or available on demand via dynamic dashboards, relieves the projects from the constant pressure to provide status reports.

#### Practice:Automate reporting to support the pull system

Just as we need automation in software development to enable flow and reduce repetitive tasks, we need that focus on reporting to take the burden off the teams where before they would create materials used only for one-time status reporting. The technology exists to automate; we need to think of innovation in reporting just as important as other technical innovation.

#### Practice: PMO is an agile team
Just as the Agile projects are constantly trying to improve, the PMO needs to grow beyond relying on “best practices” to an innovate-and-improve mindset. An Agile team reflects and acts on improvements, and the PMO is a team who can do that same. With continual attention to improving the support to projects, the overall organization will become more agile and responsive. 



### Play: Reframe the manager's role

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

In a system with self-organizing teams, where is the room for a manager? What does agile management versus leadership look like and how does this affect everyone on the team? We take a look at how the manager leads in an agile organization.

As managers with agile teams, we may find that our role has evolved, but it is still valuable. With self-organized teams, there is always this question: What do project or program managers do now? Not only do the managers themselves ask the question, but also those who report to them. The traditional hierarchy is blown up and things may get uncomfortable at first. Here we present a few shifts to consider as you engage with agile teams.

The following practices represent a progression of skillets a manager may go through. However, each practice can also be considered a stance the manager may take in order to meet the need of the team(s) regardless of progression. As a manager you should ask yourself, what type of manager do I need to be in order to best serve my team(s)?


#### Practice: Manager as facilitator
Some managers will have great success looking at themselves as a delivery facilitator. How can you make delivery easier? What roadblocks can you remove? Who can you connect to quicken the pace of the whole team?

The facilitator role can be difficult for those who are more comfortable with assigning work (or having it assigned) and receiving status until it is complete. Agile tools and reports are designed to make status seamless and available to anyone who wants it, without having to ask each other. We are hoping the team members will keep each other accountable for fulfilling their own commitments, but the facilitator still is watchful and plays a guiding hand in these interactions. He or she will still make sure the right people are talking and encourage the team members to stretch themselves.

Facilitators help everyone hold their time as valuable. They take an active role in making sure meetings are valuable, are not too long, and have the right audience in the room. So, while it’s really the broad team that develops the sprint or release plan, facilitators make sure the meeting is set up for success, with the right information and the right players. Facilitators also help the daily standup move briskly and make sure any monitoring and reporting connections are being made to sponsors and executives.

Facilitators may find that they get more opportunity to focus on the people they work with—and encourage the team members to think in that frame as well. Formerly repetitive processes associated with status are now valued less than the cohesiveness of the team and building something valuable together. Facilitators ensure time is spent reflecting and discussing how the team works together (most focused during retrospectives but welcome at any time).

#### Practice: Manager as servant leader

Through facilitative leadership, where you no longer need to direct the team but rather enable its own direction, you are ready to embrace servant leadership. In facilitation, you often learn you are not the person with the answer; rather, you look to the team for answers as it helps the individuals and team more than it helps you. And, teams are very wise. This can be a very humbling experience. The humility you learn as a facilitator guides your growth as a servant leader. You celebrate the team’s success of producing a valuable quality product. You view yourself as the person always thinking of ways to improve team members’ work-life to create their best work, by clearing impediments and not interfering. This is strange and different for those used to being the go-to person, or being a hub.

For teams used to having a clear leader to make all decisions, servant leadership can be very unnerving. Sometimes there are those who need permission to proceed. Moving to this leadership style can initially cause apprehension and delays with people who usually very efficiently complete tasks. Once again, managers facilitate an individual’s reliance on the rest of the team. Agile practice provides us tools to help individuals answer their own questions. If you are ready for more work, turn to the Kanban board for the next prioritized item on the backlog. If you are unsure about roles, refer back to the team charter. If there is anything not covered in the agile tools, talk about it and create something for yourselves (e.g., knowledge base, wiki pages).

#### Practice: Manager as coach

So you have been practicing agile for a while, and you find yourself telling stories about how your past programs handled situations. Your agile books are dog-eared and you’ve seen a lot of success and failure. Although you may hold the same role as a “Project Manager,” you have more depth to draw from and are taking more of a coaching stance with your team. You’ve found that you ask a lot more questions than give advice, and you’ve taken a deep interest in developing others to unlock their personal potential.

Just as a team starts with a more prescriptive framework, a facilitator starts with training and later is able to apply lessons informed by personal experience. Experience with people, process, and technology coalesce for someone ready to coach. A coach knows when to apply skills from mentoring, teaching, and facilitating; coaches expect to adapt rapidly and help teams do the same.

The roles may have changed, but ultimately striving for a long-term, sustainably happy work environment means living through the changes. Throughout the process, acknowledge with each other when things are uncomfortable, and examine if it’s the change or if something is truly not working. Issues may emerge that have always existed in the organization, so be ready to address them through organizational, process, or change reengineering.
