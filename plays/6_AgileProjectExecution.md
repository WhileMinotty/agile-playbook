## Agile Project Execution

Traditional project management works well for highly stable, low discovery work.

We, as an industry, have learned this approach does not work well for highly changing, high-discovery work such as software development. According to the 2017 VersionOne "State of Agile Report," 61 percent of organizations adopt agile to enhance the ability to manage changing priorities.

Agile practices respect the complexity of software delivery and other, similar high-discovery work..

Traditional project management for software delivery is often referred to as "waterfall," where each step occurs sequentially one at a time. This figure below shows the traditional Project Management Process Groups-Initiate, Plan, Execute, Monitor & Control, and Close [Project Management Academy]-and how they are modified for an agile environment. One key difference is the opportunity for feedback and learning during execution, rather than following a linear path based only on an original plan.

Here are some of the similarities and differences between traditional project management and the execution of an agile project:

#### Similarities

+ You start with an idea and plan, then execute, and close when finished.

+ You pay close attention to details during the execution process.

+ Agile project management is still project management. In the end, you are still in the same environment working with the same constraints.

#### Differences

+ Your initial planning is less rigid. A plan has only enough vision to provide direction and enable alignment.
+ There is a learning feedback loop with the end user followed by plan adjustment-not just monitoring and controlling.
+ Teams reflect and are given space to improve within the period of performance.

The figure below shows the typical project management knowledge areas and how they are modified in an agile environment. This diagram is meant to show mindset differences-not meant to be binary (black or white). Reality is usually a spectrum or a continuum where you use agility as warranted for the specific project.

#### Similarities

+ You are still dealing with the same knowledge areas.

#### Differences

+ Agile project management focuses on prototyping, learning, team building

### Play: Charter an Agile Management Office

A Project Management Office (PMO) is traditionally used to manage and control scope, schedule, cost and risk across a portfolio of projects. It's time to reimagine the PMO now that the pace and type of work has changed. The following five practices will help PMOs better support agile adoption and delivery.

#### Practice: Lead the way toward agility with agile change agents

PMOs are usually the keeper of process, and teams will tend to look to them for guidance, assurance, standardization and direction. It's time for PMOs to hold expertise in agile values, practices, and adoption. Successful agile PMOs will incorporate agile coaches to teach and mentor teams in their adoption of agile values and practices.

#### Practice: Serve and support rather than a command and control

The command and control mindset of traditional project management is insufficient for meeting the demands of high-discovery work. To the greatest extent possible, the PMO should facilitate delivery and decentralize decision making. They may establish automated reporting platforms and standards, guiding architectural and process principles, and decision-making frameworks.

#### Practice: Create a "pull" systems

With the demand for delivery, companies are constantly pushing demands to projects, stunting their ability to innovate or focus on quality. By establishing WIP limits, PMOs can help teams focus on flow, delivery, and quality.

#### Practice:Automate reporting

Just as we need automation in software development to enable flow and reduce repetitive tasks, we need that focus on reporting to take the burden off the teams. Let's get out of the business of creating single-use reporting decks, and instead focus on quality delivery. The technology exists to automate; we need to think of innovation in reporting just as important as other technical innovation.

#### Practice: Charter the PMO as an agile team

Just as the agile projects are constantly trying to improve, the PMO needs to grow beyond relying on "best practices" to an innovate-and-improve mindset. An agile team reflects and acts on improvements, and the PMO is a team who can do that same. With continual attention to improving the support to projects, the overall organization will become more agile and responsive.


### Play: Reframe the manager's role

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

In a system with self-organizing teams, where is the room for a manager? What does agile management versus leadership look like and how does this affect everyone on the team? We take a look at how the manager leads in an agile organization.

As managers with agile teams, we may find that our role has evolved, but it is still valuable. With self-organized teams, there is always this question: What do project or program managers do now? Not only do the managers themselves ask the question, but also those who report to them. The traditional hierarchy is blown up and things may get uncomfortable at first. Here we present a few shifts to consider as you engage with agile teams.

The following practices represent a progression of skillets a manager may go through. However, each practice can also be considered a stance the manager may take in order to meet the need of the team(s) regardless of progression. As a manager you should ask yourself, what type of manager do I need to be in order to best serve my team(s)?


#### Practice: Manager as facilitator
Some managers will have great success looking at themselves as a delivery facilitator. How can you make delivery easier? What roadblocks can you remove? Who can you connect to quicken the pace of the whole team?

The facilitator role can be difficult for those who are more comfortable with assigning work (or having it assigned) and receiving status until it is complete. Agile tools and reports are designed to make status seamless and available to anyone who wants it, without having to ask each other. We are hoping the team members will keep each other accountable for fulfilling their own commitments, but the facilitator still is watchful and plays a guiding hand in these interactions. He or she will still make sure the right people are talking and encourage the team members to stretch themselves.

Facilitators help everyone hold their time as valuable. They take an active role in making sure meetings are valuable, are not too long, and have the right audience in the room. So, while it’s really the broad team that develops the sprint or release plan, facilitators make sure the meeting is set up for success, with the right information and the right players. Facilitators also help the daily standup move briskly and make sure any monitoring and reporting connections are being made to sponsors and executives.

Facilitators may find that they get more opportunity to focus on the people they work with—and encourage the team members to think in that frame as well. Formerly repetitive processes associated with status are now valued less than the cohesiveness of the team and building something valuable together. Facilitators ensure time is spent reflecting and discussing how the team works together (most focused during retrospectives but welcome at any time).

#### Practice: Manager as servant leader

Through facilitative leadership, where you no longer need to direct the team but rather enable its own direction, you are ready to embrace servant leadership. In facilitation, you often learn you are not the person with the answer; rather, you look to the team for answers as it helps the individuals and team more than it helps you. And, teams are very wise. This can be a very humbling experience. The humility you learn as a facilitator guides your growth as a servant leader. You celebrate the team’s success of producing a valuable quality product. You view yourself as the person always thinking of ways to improve team members’ work-life to create their best work, by clearing impediments and not interfering. This is strange and different for those used to being the go-to person, or being a hub.

For teams used to having a clear leader to make all decisions, servant leadership can be very unnerving. Sometimes there are those who need permission to proceed. Moving to this leadership style can initially cause apprehension and delays with people who usually very efficiently complete tasks. Once again, managers facilitate an individual’s reliance on the rest of the team. Agile practice provides us tools to help individuals answer their own questions. If you are ready for more work, turn to the Kanban board for the next prioritized item on the backlog. If you are unsure about roles, refer back to the team charter. If there is anything not covered in the agile tools, talk about it and create something for yourselves (e.g., knowledge base, wiki pages).

#### Practice: Manager as coach

So you have been practicing agile for a while, and you find yourself telling stories about how your past programs handled situations. Your agile books are dog-eared and you’ve seen a lot of success and failure. Although you may hold the same role as a “Project Manager,” you have more depth to draw from and are taking more of a coaching stance with your team. You’ve found that you ask a lot more questions than give advice, and you’ve taken a deep interest in developing others to unlock their personal potential.

Just as a team starts with a more prescriptive framework, a facilitator starts with training and later is able to apply lessons informed by personal experience. Experience with people, process, and technology coalesce for someone ready to coach. A coach knows when to apply skills from mentoring, teaching, and facilitating; coaches expect to adapt rapidly and help teams do the same.

The roles may have changed, but ultimately striving for a long-term, sustainably happy work environment means living through the changes. Throughout the process, acknowledge with each other when things are uncomfortable, and examine if it’s the change or if something is truly not working. Issues may emerge that have always existed in the organization, so be ready to address them through organizational, process, or change reengineering.
