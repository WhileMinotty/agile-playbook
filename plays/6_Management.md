# Management

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

As managers with agile teams, we may find that our role has evolved, but it is still valuable. With self-organized teams there is always this question; What do project or program managers do now?  Not only do the managers themselves ask the question, but also those who report to them.  The traditional hierarchy is blown up and things may get uncomfortable at first.  Here we present a few shifts to consider as you engage with agile teams. 

### Play - Manager as faciliator
Some managers will have great success looking at themselves as a delivery facilitator. How can you make delivery easier? What roadblocks can you remove? Who can you connect to quicken the pace of the whole team?

The facilitator role can be difficult for those who are more comfortable with assigning work (or having it assigned) and receiving status until it is complete.  Agile tools and reports are designed to make status seamless and availble to anyone who wants it, without having to ask each other. We are hoping that the team will keep each other accountable to fulfilling their own commitments; but the facilitator still is watchful and plays a guiding hand in these interactions. He or she will still make sure the right people are talking, and encourage the team to stretch themselves.

Facilitators help everyone hold their time as valuable. They take an active role in making sure meetings are valuable, not too long, and have the right audience in the room. So, while it's really the the broad team that develops the sprint or release plan, facilitators make sure that the meeting is set up for success, with the right information, and the right players. Facilitators also help the daily standup move briskly and make sure that any monitoring and reporting connectsions are being made to sponsors and executives. 

Facilitators may find that they get more opportunity to focus on the people they work with -- and encourage the team members to think in that frame as well. Formerly repetitive processes associated with status, are now valued less than the cohesiveness of the team and building something valuable together.  Facilitators ensure time is spent reflecting and discussing how the team works together (most focused during retrospectives but welcome at any time). 

## Play - Embrace servant leadership

Through facilitative leadership, where you're no longer needing to direct the team, but rather enabling their own direction of themselves, you are ready to embrace servant leadership.  In facilitation, you often learn you are not the person with the answer, rather you look to the team for answers as it helps the individuals and team, more than it helps you.  And, teams are very wise. This can be a very humbling experience.  The humility you learn as a facilitator guides your growth as a servant leader.  You celebrate the teamâ€™s success of producing a valuable quality product.  You view yourself as the person always thinking of ways to improve their worklife to create their best work, by clearing impediments and not interfering.  This is strange and different for those used to being the go-to person, or being a hub.  

For teams used to having a clear leader to make all decisions, this type of leadership can be very unnerving.  Sometimes there are those who need permission to proceed.  Moving to this leadership style can initially cause apprehension and delays with people who are usually very efficiently completing tasks.  Once again, facilitate individuals reliance on the rest of the team. Agile practice provide us tools to help individuals answer their own questions.  If you are ready for more work, turn to the Kanban board for the next prioritized item on the backlog.  If you are unsure about roles, refer back to the team charter.  If there is anything not covered in the agile tools, talk about it and create something for yourselves (e.g. knowledge base, wiki pages, etc).

##Play - Manager as coach

So you have been practicing agile for a while, and you find yourself telling stories about how your past programs handled situations.  Your agile books are dog-eared and you've seen a lot of success and failure.  Although you may hold the same role as a "Project Manager" you have more depth to draw from and are taking more of a coaching stance with your team.  You've found that you ask a lot more questions than give advice, and you've taken a deep interst in developing others, to unlock their personal potential. 

Just as a team starts with a more prescriptive framework to get started, a facilitator starts with training and later is able to apply lessons informed by personal experience.  Experience with people, process and technology bundle for someone ready to coach.  A coach knows when to apply skills from mentoring, teaching and facilitating; coaches expect to adapt rapidly, and helps teams do the same.  

The roles may have changed, but ultimately striving for a long term, sustainably happy work environment means living through the changes.  Throughout the process acknowledge with each other when things are uncomfortable, and examine if its the change, or if something is truely not working.  Issues may emerge that have always exsisted in the organization, so be ready to address them through organizational, process, or change reengineering.
