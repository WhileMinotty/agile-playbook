### Play - Move from manager to faciliator

Self-organized teams inevitably leads to the question; What do project or program managers do now?  Not only do the managers themselves ask the question, but also those who report to them.  The traditional hierarchy is blown up and things get uncomfortable.  The first step to accepting the new way is to acknowledge the manager now is more of a facilitator who embraces servant leadership.

The facilitator role is difficult for those who are more comfortable with assigning work (or having it assigned) and receiving status until it is complete.  Agile tools provide the capability for anyone to  pull status when needed from an information radiator.  This style of progress/status can uncomfortable for the team member as well as the manager.  Both are used to proving their worth every day through status discussions, they may miss the connection or ability to get daily reinforcement they are on track.  This reinforcement now comes from team members who may not know how to support each other in that way.  In comes the role of facilitator.  S/he can help in the daily standup, as an example, asking leading questions "John, was the input what you needed from Jane?" Good facilitation can enhance what would formally been feedback from the manager, to help build relationships within the team.  

In addition to the move from valuing status, the facilitator now has the ability to help the team self-organize by executing planning events where the team can concentrate on the work.  Although the team develops the sprint or release plan, this new role helps them execute through daily standup, monitoring and reporting measurements to upper management, executing ceremonies, and concentrating on improving the human happiness.

The most positive aspect of moving to a facilitator role, is that there is more time to focus on developing individuals and the team.  Formerly repetitive processes associated with status, are now valued less than the cohesiveness of the team and building together.  This is shown through the time spent in reflecting and discussing how the team works together (most focused during retrospectives but welcome at any time).  The facilitator now has time to help the individual achieve goals also, through enabling interesting work on the team, and working through a long term career path.  Although the role may be initially uncomfortable, its vital enabling agility on the team and scaling to the organization.
