## Adaptation

Adaptation is key to improving team outcomes and adjusting as the environment and team change. In this section, we look at a couple of ways to regularly examine and find ways to improve the team and product.

Routinely adapting—and expecting adaptation—are vital to a healthy agile project and a healthy agile team.

### Play: Reflect on how the team works together


If a team must pick only one agile practice to adopt, it should be retrospectives! As a way to inspect and adapt the way the team works together, they become a vital part of a healthy team. They take the form of a regular meeting for a team to be able to pause and reflect on how things are going, adjust process, and reflect on areas of improvement with each other. The simplest form of a retrospective would be to come together and ask a team questions like, What are we doing well? What aren’t we doing well? What would we change for the next few weeks? Retrospectives should be common enough that the team is comfortable experimenting with things. It is an opportunity to tune processes and behaviors. In addition to improving the work, it build trust and cohesiveness in the team. Many teams fall into a trap of skipping retrospectives when pressure is on. Don’t do it! Treat retrospectives with importance, and reach out to another facilitator or a coach if you’re having trouble finding value in the meeting. Holding a retrospective about once per month is a healthy practice for most teams.

We always recommend Agile Retrospectives \[Derby and Larsen, 2006\] to increase your skills in conducting retrospectives. But there is no better learning than by doing.

> **Anti-Pattern - Under pressure, so skip the retrospective** >  When a team feels they are behind on work committed, or unexpected issues arise that take their time, its easy to think the retrospective is too long a time committment.  Sometimes you have to slow down to go faster.  The retrospective is an investment in team.  Without the opportunity to reflect in an alloted time, the team will contiue to push aside issues that are affecting their velocity.  The mindset that it is an investment will help the team ultimately become more effective.

### Play: Take an empirical view
Be ready for experiments! We are engaged in creative knowledge work that did not exist yesterday. We can’t expect to have all the answers. But we can expect to design smart experiments, try things, and learn. Apply this principle in all you do.

Whether you’re deciding what technology framework to use, or you’re just trying to spend less time on help desk tickets, consider an empirical view. Reach back to elementary school and borrow from the scientific method basics:

* Define the problem.
* Form a hypothesis.
* Define the resources you’ll need from your team.
* Conduct an experiment—and experiment with only one variable at a time.
* Gather data—compile test data once completed.
* Consider what you learned. Take action on findings.

Keep an open mind about experiments to conduct; they can include technical, interface, process, or people.
