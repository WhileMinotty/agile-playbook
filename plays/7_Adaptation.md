#### Play: Reflect on how the team works together
If a team must  pick one agile practice to adopt, it should be retrospectives! As a way to inspect and adaopt the way the team works tegether they become a vital part of a healthy team. They take the form of a regular meeting for a team to be able to pause and reflect on how things are going, and adust their process, and reflect areas of improvement to each other. The simplest form of a retrospective would be to come together and ask a team questions like, What are we doing well? What aren't we doing well? And what would we change for the next few weeks? Retrospectives should be common enough that the team is comfortable experiementing with things. It is an opportortunity to tune processes and behaviors.  In addition to improving the work, it build trust and coheasiveness in the team. Many teams fall into a trap of skipping retrospectives when pressure is on. Don't do it! Treat retrospectives with importance, and reach out to another facilitator or a coach if you're having trouble finding value in the meeting. Holding a retrospective about once per month is a healthy practice for most teams.

_Agile Retrospectives_, by Esther Derby and Diana Larson is the book we always recommend to grow in your skill conducting retrospectives. But there is no better learning than by doing.

#### Play - Take an empirical view
Kanban often refers to doing experiements look at the current process and help determine better ways to execute.  To start, review areas that there is often wait time involved, regular quality issues, or unoredictability where there should be predictability.  Next reach back to elementary school and borrow from the scientific method basics:
 
 - Define the problem
 - Form a Hypothesis
 - Define The resources youâ€™ll need from your team
 - Conduct Experiment - Always have a control group and an experiment with only on variable at a time
 - Gather Data: Compiling test data once completed
 - Take action on findings

Keep and open mind on experiments to conduct, these can include technical, interface, process, or people.
