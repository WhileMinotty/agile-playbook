## Inspect and Adapt

#### Retrospectives
If a team must only pick one agile practice to adopt, it should be retrospectives! Retrospectives are a vital part of a healthy team. They take the form of a regular meeting for a team to be able to pause and reflect on how things are going, and adust their process, and reflect areas of improvement to each other. The simplest form of a retrospective would be to come together and ask a team questions like, What are we doing well? What aren't we doing well? And what would we change for the next few weeks? Retrospectives should be common enough that the team is comfortable experiementing with things. If what you try doesn't work out, you can talk about it at the next retrospective and try something different next time. Many teams fall into a trap of skipping retrospectives when pressure is on. Don't do it! Treat retrospectives with importance, and reach out to another facilitator or a coach if you're having trouble finding value in the meeting. Holding a retrospective about once per month is a healthy practice for most teams.

_Agile Retrospectives_, by Esther Derby and Diana Larson is the book we always recommend to grow in your skill conducting retrospectives. But there is no better learning than by doing.
