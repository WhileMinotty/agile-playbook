# Adaptation
Routinely adapting -- and expecting adaptation -- are vital to a healthy agile project, and a healthy agile team. 

## Play - Reflect on how the team works together
If a team must pick only one agile practice to adopt, it should be retrospectives! As a way to inspect and adapt the way the team works together they become a vital part of a healthy team. They take the form of a regular meeting for a team to be able to pause and reflect on how things are going, and adjust their process, and reflect areas of improvement to each other. The simplest form of a retrospective would be to come together and ask a team questions like, What are we doing well? What aren't we doing well? And what would we change for the next few weeks? Retrospectives should be common enough that the team is comfortable experimenting with things. It is an opportunity to tune processes and behaviors.  In addition to improving the work, it build trust and cohesiveness in the team. Many teams fall into a trap of skipping retrospectives when pressure is on. Don't do it! Treat retrospectives with importance, and reach out to another facilitator or a coach if you're having trouble finding value in the meeting. Holding a retrospective about once per month is a healthy practice for most teams.

_Agile Retrospectives_, by Esther Derby and Diana Larson is the book we always recommend to grow in your skill conducting retrospectives. But there is no better learning than by doing.

## Play - Take an empirical view
Be ready for experiments! We are engaged in creative knowledge work that did not exist yesterday. We can't expect to have all the answers. But we can expect is to design smart experiments, try things, and learn. Apply this principle in all you do. 

Whether you're deciding what technology framework to use, or you're just trying to spend less time on helpdesk tickets, consider an empirical view. Reach back to elementary school and borrow from the scientific method basics:
 
 - Define the problem
 - Form a Hypothesis
 - Define The resources youâ€™ll need from your team
 - Conduct Experiment - Experiment with only one variable at a time
 - Gather Data: Compiling test data once completed
 - What did we learn? Take action on findings

Keep an open mind on experiments to conduct, these can include technical, interface, process, or people.
