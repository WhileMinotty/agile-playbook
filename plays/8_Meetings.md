## Meetings

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

### Play: Have *valuable* meetings

Effective meetings bring value to a team in the form of common understanding. The richest form of communication is face-to-face communications while drawing on a whiteboard to express ideas beyond words. Codified meetings are a central element in implementing agile, and they serve several purposes:

* The team gets to know each other and builds respect.
* Ideas can be expressed, built upon, and finalized—facilitating a shorter learning cycle.
* Meetings reinforce face-to-face communication, or at the very least talking. 
* They give regular check-in points and a rhythm to work.
* They reduce the need for documentation to be passed around as a primary form of communication.

The following table provides an overview of the types of meetings the agile team can employ during its project’s lifecycle.

##### Useful, possibly valuable meetings

| Meeting | Main Purpose | Frequency | Delivery Team | Value Team/Client | 
| ------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- | ----------------- | 
| Release Planning | Scoping, Acceptance Criteria, User Story Designs for Product Backlog, Release Plan | Once per Release (may occur quarterly) | Scrum Master, Development Team, SMEs | Product Owner |
| Sprint Planning | Sprint Plan, Sprint Backlog | Once per Sprint | Scrum Master, Development Team, SMEs | Product Owner |
| Backlog Refinement | Product Backlog Review, Prioritization of User Stories | Once per Sprint | Scrum Master, Development Team | Product Owner |
| Sprint Review | Completed User Story Review, Feedback, Review of the Definition of Done, Demonstration of New Features, Fix Defects | Once per Sprint | Scrum Master, Development Team, SMEs | Product Owner |
| Sprint Retrospective | Evaluation, Potential Improvements, Impediment Log Review | At the End of Each Sprint | Scrum Master, Development Team, SMEs | Product Owner |
| Daily Standup | Identification of Risks, Project Team Progress, Burndown Chart Reviews, Obstacles/ Impediments/ Resolutions, User Story Reviews | Daily | Scrum Master, Development Team, SMEs | Product Owner | 

##### Effective facilitation of meetings 

* Plan as far in advance as possible. Regular meetings should be on everyone’s radar far in advance. 
* Emphasize the importance of the meeting as part of work.
* Ensure everyone feels comfortable contributing by asking opinions and giving everyone a chance to talk. 
* Timebox and keep to the timebox. Adding time to the planned meeting just contributes to the feeling that meetings are not useful. 
* Stick to the agenda. Use tools like a parking lot to determine follow-on meetings. 
* Provide notes for the meeting in an easily accessible place so decisions are not lost. 
* Meet in the same team space as much as possible. Keep things like your sprint Kanban board there and refer to it during meetings. 
* Emphasize respect for each other. Only one person should speak at a time. 
* Build working agreements. Ensure a working agreement for meetings is discussed for each type of meeting. 
* Review actions from previous meetings to ensure team members are keeping commitments and get the assistance they need.
