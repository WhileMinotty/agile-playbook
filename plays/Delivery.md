> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.


# Probably SPARC

The agile software world [uses Scrum extensively](http://stateofagile.versionone.com).
Scrum is an powerful, lightweight product delivery framework that has existed for 25 years.
The definitive description of the framework is maintained by its creators in the [Scrum Guides](http://www.scrumguides.org).

talk about how scrum is great for pumping out software on a regular basis.
talk about how scrum is especially good when new feature development is the primary objective.
talk about how it is a great entry point to the agile world.
provide a brief description ofthe scrum process, possibly quoting words from the scrum guide.
Include a picture of the scrum process.  We have one but it is not the best.

| Play: | _Start with Scrum for agile delivery, but with an eye for "agility"_ |
| ---:  | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1    | We believe that teams looking to adopt an Agile mindset should start with Scrum. It is a lightweight and straightfoward framework that can quickly accelerate software delivery. **As a point of caution,** teams should take stock to be grounded in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). Over time, the team's implementation of Scrum should change as the team matures and the work moves forward. |

give a brief description of scrumban - essnetially it is scrum where the team is capable and encouraged to release as often as possible.  primarily the scrum framework serves to give the team reoccurring opportunities to regularly plan, show, and reflect on how they work, when such things do not happen naturally.  
it is really good for operations and maitenance teams who have to pump out bug fixes and patches as soon as possible.

| Play: | _ScrumBan for teams that need or want to release as soon as possible _ |

give a brief description of Kanban, continuous flow, and limiting work in process to raise throughput.
Talk about how it is a very advanced technique reserved for the most disciplined teams. TESTING TESTING......

| Play: | _Try Kanban on only the most disciplined teams and when **throughput** is paramount._ |

More than 70 percent of the organizations using Agile have adopted Scrum or Scrum variants, as noted from the survey results conducted by VersionOne®. (See Appendix D for additional details.) Agile programs at Booz Allen have also overwhelmingly employed Scrum as the foundational framework for implementing the Agile mindset through a set of proven repeatable results using Agile practices. For this reason, we have used Scrum as the basis for developing Booz Allen’s Agile Development Model and recommended it as a team’s entry point into Agile development, with other Agile frameworks (e.g. Kanban) reserved for more experienced Agile teams.

For newly formed Agile teams, the recommended approach is to integrate Booz Allen’s Agile Development Model with the capabilities offered through our SmartSuite integrated lifecycle management tool set. The iterative nature of Agile and associated processes that comprise the Agile Development Model (see Figure 1) are presented in Booz Allen’s Organizational Standard Process (OSP), which provides a set of standard engineering lifecycle processes for use by systems and software development projects. The OSP is housed in the Process Director (PD) application (Thin Client version) and is accessible online.


###2.1	SCRUM AS A FRAMEWORK
Scrum is an iterative, incremental Agile framework for managing software development projects. Its focus is “a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal” as opposed to a “traditional, sequential approach.”  Our Agile Development Model (See Figure 1) incorporates several Scrum practices that are described later in this playbook. But first, we introduce you to key terminology. Bear in mind that Scrum employs time-boxed events (defined periods of time during which a task must be completed), including Product Backlog Development, Release Planning Meeting, Sprint Planning Meeting, Sprint, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Daily Standup Meetings.

User Stories depict high-level definitions of requirements that address specific functionality of the product and are planned and executed across a series of Sprints (tightly time-boxed events that include repetitive development cycles). The project team uses Burndown Charts to track estimated work versus actual work to ensure development activities execute on schedule. Velocity determines how much Product Backlog effort the team can take on in a given Sprint. Daily Standup Meetings promote team communication and interaction on a regular and consistent basis. These meetings also identify potential blockers or impediments in the workflow, which are then handled outside the Daily Standup Meeting by only the required stakeholders.

Sprints, which generally last about a month, provide a process for the team to design, code, build, test, and then potentially release functioning features of a given product. The process begins with Release Planning, followed by Sprint Planning, and Sprint Execution. Upon conclusion of the Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review to discuss what has been accomplished (demonstration of new features created during the Sprint) and then concludes with a Sprint Retrospective (similar to lessons learned).

It is important to note that, in many cases, the project team may not release the software to system end users after each Sprint, but rather focus on incrementally creating working software for the Product Owner to review and validate against expectations. **Figure 1** on the following page captures the Booz Allen approach to Agile development.
