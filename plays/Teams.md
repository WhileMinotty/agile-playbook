> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

### Introduction
Agile teams are cross functional in nature and work together to analyze, design, and build the solution our customers need. 

### The Scrum Team
Scrum gives us a simple frame for a team, and we believe this is a valuable frame for most agile teams. Scrum suggests just three roles:
- Scrum Master 
- Product Owner
- Team Member

#### The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is an experienced agilist, responsible for upholding agile values and principles for the delivery effort. The Scrum Master helps the team execute its agreed-upon delivery process and typically facilitates common team ceremonies, like daily standup meetings, planning meetings, demos, retrospectives, and so-on. The Scrum Master biases the team toward action and delivery and stretches the team to continuously improve, hold each other accountable, and take ownership of the way it works.

Although the term Scrum refers to a specific agile framework that delivers software on a strict cadence, the notion of a delivery team facilitator in an agile team is so common and so effective, we feel it's simplest to refer to this person as a Scrum Master, even for a non-Scrum team, given it is the most common term for that role.

In a team, Scrum Masters typically:
1. Make sure the right people are talking together, all the time
2. Remove barriers for the team ​
3. Reflect progress back to the team
4. Shield the team from interruptions
5. Ensure that the team's process is followed, including facilitating team ceremonies
6. Coach and mentor the team and customers in living out agile values and principles
7. Tune into team morale, energy, and conflict and address issues 
8. Ensures that the team has an environment that fosters productivity, openness, and teamwork​
​

#### The Product Owner
The Product Owner is the single person most considering the mission or business value of the solution being developed. They are responsible for maximizing the return on investment (ROI) for the development effor and they speak for the interests of the users. They could be from the client organization; but in the case they are from the Booz Allen team, they represent the client’s perspective. They interact regularly with the delivery team, clarifying the needs, and providing feedback on designs, prototypes, and iterations of the solution. 

Product Owners typically:
1. Create and maintain the Product Backlog
2. Prioritize and sequence the Backlog according to business value
3. Assist with elaboration of Epics, Themes, Features into User Stories that are granular enough to be completed soon (like a single sprint)
4. Convey the vision and goals for the project, for every release, for every sprint
5. Represent and engage the customer
6. Participate in regular team ceremonies (standups, planning, reviews, retrospectives)
7. Inspect progress every sprint; accept or reject work, and explain why
8. Steer the team’s direction at sprint boundaries
9. Communicate status externally
10. Terminate a sprint when drastic change is required


#### The Team Member
Team members are, of course, the other members of the team, such as testers, developers, designers. They are the people who, collectively, work together to deliver value on the project. They will carry a diverse set of skills and expertise, but they are happy to help out in areas that are not their speciality. Team members, together, take collecitve responsibility for the total solution, rather than "just my job." Team members do whatever they can to help the team meet its sprint goal and build a successful product. 

### On team size
Our experience shows that a cross-functional 10-person team is the preferred maximum team size. This size is also supported by PMI-ACP guidelines and follows general Scrum guidelines. This would include having a dedicated person as Scrum Master, and another as Product Owner. As the project size scales beyond 10, the effectiveness of the team, per-person declines, and significantly more time is spent coordinating work. If the scale of the work requires a large team, we need to think about how that can be divided into multiple cross-functional teams that are tightly coordinated, but loosely coupled.

### Team structure patterns
In its simplest frame, Agile teams have people who focus on the value of things -- what needs to be built --  and other folks focused on the delivery of things -- how we will build it, what's possible. Though they are operating as a single team -- with one goal, one purpose -- you can also consider that there are two virtual, smaller teams here: a Value Team, and a Delivery Team. There are a few patterns we see work well, so we want to explain those in the next three headings:

#### The Squad
We strongly believe in keeping things as simple as possible. And the simplest team is under 10 people, has a dedicated single Product Owner, and a dedicated single Scrum Master. This team is dedicated to just one project at a time and can plan and estimate together. This team tends to be very predictible, has great potential for high-performance, and really enjoys working together. 

#### Expanding to a Value Team
If the mission needs are sufficiently complex or there are complicated relationships with multiple client stakeholders, it might be impossible to have just one Product Owner. In that case, we recommend thinking of a larger Value Team. This team might grow, itself, to around 10 people and would typically have representatives in it like business analysts, compliance interests, end-users, and so-on. In this case, there can still be a Product Owner, but that person is now the Value Team's facilitator, bringing together all those perspectives and creating a common voice, but not really having a trumping perspective. The jobs of the Scrum Master and Product Owner become more difficult, trying to arrange coordination of all the interests at play, but it can still be very successful.

#### Further expanding to include multiple Delivery Teams and Value Teams
If the overall solution scope is so large, expertise required is sufficiently diverse, or timeline constrained such that a single team is insuffcient to produce the solution, then you'll have to scale up to multiple Delivery Teams, each with their own Product Owner/Value Team. There are a few frameworks that help shape this, which are discussed later in this Playbook, about scaling agile. Additional roles are likely required, like architects to keep the technology sufficiently robust and coordinated.

### Practices for building stronger teams
Teams become better teams by working together over time. But there are also practices teams can put into place that can facilitate the teaming process. A couple we recommend are:

#### Retrospectives
If a team must only pick one agile practice to adopt, it should be retrospectives! Retrospectives are a vital part of a healthy team. They take the form of a regular meeting for a team to be able to pause and reflect on how things are going, and adust their process, and reflect areas of improvement to each other. The simplest form of a retrospective would be to come together and ask a team questions like, What are we doing well? What aren't we doing well? And what would we change for the next few weeks? Retrospectives should be common enough that the team is comfortable experiementing with things. If what you try doesn't work out, you can talk about it at the next retrospective and try something different next time. Many teams fall into a trap of skipping retrospectives when pressure is on. Don't do it! Treat retrospectives with importance, and reach out to another facilitator or a coach if you're having trouble finding value in the meeting.

_Agile Retrospectives_, by Esther Derby and Diana Larson is the book we always recommend reading to grow in your skill conducting retrospectives.

#### Chartering
At the beginning of a project, or after signficiant change on a project (in scope, or in team makeup), we recommend team chartering. This is a meeting, ideally in-person, together -- even for a team that's otherwise distributed. And the real focus of this meeting is: Who are we, and what are we doing? We recommend working through activities to get to know each other, find out what each members skills and passions are. How do you like to have fun? How do you like to communicate? What makes you happy? What makes you frustrated? You'll likely want a good facilitator to pull this chartering meeting together, but teams find it has lasting effects on the sense of community, empathy for each other, and overall effectiveness.


### On physical proximity
- Colocaton
- Distributed teams
