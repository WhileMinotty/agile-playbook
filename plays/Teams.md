### Introduction
Agile teams are cross functional in nature and work together to analyze, design, and build the solution our customers need. 

### The Scrum Team
Scrum gives us a simple frame for a team, and we believe this is a valuable frame for most agile teams. Scrum suggests just three roles:
- Scrum Master 
- Product Owner
- Team Member

#### The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is an experienced agilist, responsible for upholding agile values and principles for the delivery effort. The Scrum Master helps the team execute its agreed-upon delivery process and typically facilitates common team ceremonies, like daily standup meetings, planning meetings, demos, retrospectives, and so-on. The Scrum Master biases the team toward action and delivery and stretches the team to continuously improve, hold each other accountable, and take ownership of the way it works.

Although the term Scrum refers to a specific agile framework that delivers software on a strict cadence, the notion of a delivery team facilitator in an agile team is so common and so effective, we feel it's simplest to refer to this person as a Scrum Master, even for a non-Scrum team, given it is the most common term for that role.

In a team, Scrum Masters typically:
1. Make sure the right people are talking together, all the time
2. Remove barriers for the team ​
3. Reflect progress back to the team
4. Shield the team from interruptions
5. Ensure that the team's process is followed, including facilitating team ceremonies
6. Coach and mentor the team and customers in living out agile values and principles
7. Tune into team morale, energy, and conflict and address issues 
8. Ensures that the team has an environment that fosters productivity, openness, and teamwork​
​

#### The Product Owner
The Product Owner is the single person most considering the mission or business value of the solution being developed. They are responsible for maximizing the return on investment (ROI) for the development effor and they speak for the interests of the users. They could be from the client organization; but in the case they are from the Booz Allen team, they represent the client’s perspective. They interact regularly with the delivery team, clarifying the needs, and providing feedback on designs, prototypes, and iterations of the solution. 

Product Owners typically:
1. Create and maintain the Product Backlog
2. Prioritize and sequence the Backlog according to business value
3. Assist with elaboration of Epics, Themes, Features into User Stories that are granular enough to be completed soon (like a single sprint)
4. Convey the vision and goals for the project, for every release, for every sprint
5. Represent and engage the customer
6. Participate in regular team ceremonies (standups, planning, reviews, retrospectives)
7. Inspect progress every sprint; accept or reject work, and explain why
8. Steer the team’s direction at sprint boundaries
9. Communicate status externally
10. Terminate a sprint when drastic change is required


#### The Team Member
Team members are, of course, the other members of the team, such as testers, developers, designers. They are the people who, collectively, work together to deliver value on the project. They will carry a diverse set of skills and expertise, but they are happy to help out in areas that are not their speciality. Team members, together, take collecitve responsibility for the total solution, rather than "just my job." Team members do whatever they can to help the team meet its sprint goal and build a successful product. 

### On team size
Our experience shows that a cross-functional 10-person team is the preferred maximum team size. This size is also supported by PMI-ACP guidelines and follows general Scrum guidelines. This would include having a dedicated person as Scrum Master, and another as Product Owner. As the project size scales beyond 10, the effectiveness of the team, per-person declines, and significantly more time is spent coordinating work. If the scale of the work requires a large team, we need to think about how that can be divided into multiple cross-functional teams that are tightly coordinated, but loosely coupled.

### Team structure patterns
In its simplest frame, Agile teams have people who focus on the value of things -- what needs to be built --  and other folks focused on the delivery of things -- how we will build it, what's possible. Though they are operating as a single team -- one goal, one purpose -- you can also consider that there are two virtual, smaller teams here: a Value Team, and a Delivery Team.

###RECOMMENDED AGILE TEAM STRUCTURE
Booz Allen Agile teams are cross functional in nature and work collectively to determine how and when the product will be built and delivered to the client. A standard Agile Team structure comprises a Delivery Team and a Value Team.
####ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

An Agile Team includes an interdisciplinary mix of individuals. Together, they form an Agile community committed to project success. Depending on the scope of the project, the size and organization of these teams vary, as do the names and roles.

The roles listed in this playbook serve as a basic structure for organizing an Agile Team. Keep in mind that Agile projects executing a Scrum-like framework generally engage a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and the team described in Table 1. For teams new to adoption of the Agile mindset, an Agile Coach role should also be established on the team. While not necessarily a full-time member of the Delivery Team, the Agile Coach is an experienced “Agilist,” who facilitates team events (e.g., Standup Meetings, Sprint Planning) early in the project. The Agile Coach also helps the team adhere to the Agile mindset, provides mentorship, and optimizes the processes to promote value-based delivery.


###Standard Agile Team Structure 



###The Delivery Team
The Delivery Team is a cross-functional group that possesses all the skills and resources necessary to deliver valuable, high-quality, tested products to the client. In a software context, a typical team consists of developers, architects, testers, and systems engineers. This team works together in a highly communicative and collaborative manner, taking collective ownership of the product delivered and resolving any bugs/defects that may be encountered. High-performing Agile teams are self-organizing—able to drive themselves toward delivering the highest value software for the client.
###The Value Team
The Value Team’s responsibility is to communicate and represent the client’s needs by defining priorities and acknowledging acceptance when the product meets the intended need. The Value Team can be as small as one person (often called the Product Owner, a key stakeholder who also represents the client), but a larger team may consist of a group of users, business analysts, and members of the Program Management Office. A chief responsibility of the Value Team is to own the Product Backlog—the prioritized list of all the work yet to be completed. The Value Team must also provide regular feedback about the working product the Delivery Team demonstrates. To attain the maximum benefit of Agile development, the Value Team must be readily available to the Delivery Team to respond to questions and provide feedback.
###ROLES BASED ON TEAM SIZE


Roles and responsibilities vary if the team is particularly small or large, because it is easier to implement Agile with small team constraints versus attempting to scale broadly. Sub roles can be incorporated into the Agile Team structure, based on small or large projects. Suggested configurations include:

* **Small Project** (six team members or fewer) > Scrum Master role may overlap with Project Manager and Agile Coach responsibilities; team members possess multiple areas of expertise (e.g., Analyst may also serve as a Tester); Product Owner remains a distinct role.
* **Large Project** (15 team members or more) > Agile Coach must have experience with large Agile projects; the project is likely to have multiple Product Owners, with a single Lead Product Owner assigned for the entire system; Team Product Owners are treated as a proxy for that single voice.

When large projects are involved, facilitate collaboration among the Product Owners, Team Leads, and Development staff through the “Scrum of Scrums” practice. In a large team environment, it may be inefficient for all staff to attend Daily Standup Meetings.

Restrict these meetings to four or five members, and conduct multiple standup meetings if necessary, to keep them short, focused, and effective. Finally, unique Project Manager, Scrum Master, Architect, Requirements Manager, Test Manager, Quality Assurance (QA) Manager, and Configuration Manager roles are required for the project. These norms and responsibilities should be finalized as a part of Sprint 0 activities.

**Table 2** provides a list of additional roles that may be included in Agile sub teams for both small and large projects.
