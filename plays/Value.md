Communicating Vision
-----

###Product Vision Statement
The vision for the project should be encapsulated in a Product Vision Statement created by the product owner.  Akin to an ‘elevator pitch’, or quick summary, the goal of the Product Vision Statement is to communicate the value that the software will add to the company. It should be clear and direct enough to be understood by every level of the effort, including project stakeholders.

###Vision Box
If defining the Product Vision Statement is proving a struggle, or there is a need for a slightly more in-depth look into the overall vision before proceeding with planning, a Vision Box is an excellent, engaging, and, often, fun exercise to define the vision and value of a project. [ Elaborate ]

###Product Roadmap
With a Vision Statement and potentially a Vision Box in place, a Product Roadmap should be created to consider more specific (although still high-level) objectives and direction for the project.  Be sure to include the ultimate project goals in the Roadmap, keeping in mind their value added and the desired outcomes from the customer’s point of view.  It should loosely encapsulate the progression of development as well as the overall vision.  Rough sizing of work and prioritization should also occur as a part of the Product Roadmap creation process.

###Release Map
Once the Roadmap is complete, a Release Plan may be created for the first release.  Each release should begin with the creation of a Release Plan specific to the goals and priorities for that release.  This ensures that the value being added to the project is consistently reviewed and if necessary, realigned, to maximize the overall value and efficiency of development.   Like the Product Roadmap, the Release Plan should include a high level timeline of the progression of development, specific to the priorities for that release only.  The highest value items should be released first, allowing the stakeholders visibility into the progression of the work.

Backlog Basics: 
Treat your backlog as a “catch all” - as long as the item directly correlates to a final product or project goal, then irrespective of if the item is related to true functional work, is an enhancement or even technical debt it can be added to your backlog. Additionally, keep in mind that your backlog will be ever-evolving. Your backlog should be a living, breathing testament to your product as you will be iteratively refining your backlog as your build your product. Product Backlog items are updated until all features of that product are delivered, which may occur through multiple releases during the project lifecycle. 

Types of Backlogs: Product & Sprint
A product backlog is a prioritized list of product requirements presented as User Stories, updated at least weekly, and ranked and estimated using a scale based on Story Points. It serves as a high-level view of the work that must be completed to create the product and it is typically owned by the Product Owner. 
A sprint backlog is a detailed list of all tasks from the product backlog that must be completed based on the user stories assigned to a given sprint, updated daily, modified through the sprint process, and classified as “Done” in accordance with the team’s definition.

###USER STORIES
User Stories make up the Product Backlog. To create value-driven stories that accurately reflect the client’s requirements, think of the acronym DEEP: Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized. To expand on this concept, a User Story should be _Detailed_ enough so that everyone understands the need, including acceptance criteria that define when the User Story is considered “Done.” Without getting into implementation, the detail provided should be sufficient for the Delivery Team to provide an _Estimated_ value of the amount of effort it will take to implement a User Story. (Stories near the top of the Product Backlog can be estimated more accurately than those near the bottom.) The Product Backlog should contain those stories that are considered Emergent—reflecting current, pressing, and/ or realistic needs. And, of course, the Product Backlog should be Prioritized so that everyone under- stands which stories are most important now and require implementation.
Most Agile teams use the concept of User Stories to help define how the work will be accomplished. A User Story is essentially a business need captured and stored in the Product Backlog.

####Strong v. Weak User Stories


| **Strong User Stories Are…** | **Weak User Stories Are…** | 
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| - Developed and prioritized by the Product Owner | - Developed without designating the specific user or user group that will receive value from the story’s |
| - Written from the user’s perspective, implementation and employ user roles | - Created with limited Product Owner involvement |
| - Simple and concise, with clear alignment to business value | - Missing a description of the business value |
| - Entry points to a conversation on how the implementation activities can be decomposed | - Technical specifications which don’t link to the user’s point of view |
| - Written with easy to understand success criteria | - Open-ended with no means to validate acceptance |
