> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

> *Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.*

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.



## Preliminary Outline for Value

1. Communicating Vision / Prioritization Considerations and Techniques
  1. Where to start
    * Elevator Pitch/Overarching Vision and Goal -> product box
  2. Where to start if you don’t know where to start
    * Figure who your stakeholders are
    * Define stakeholder roles and goals
    * Personas
  3. Discovery session exercise/requirements gathering/wish list 
2. Initial Requirements Gathering
  1. Evaluation of current business state
    * What business problem are we trying to solve?
    * Self evaluation-driven questions -- what VALUE do they need from the software
    * Expected Behaviors to solve the business problem
    * Desired and Intuitive Interactions
    * Discuss difference between “I need the software to have one button for each department in my business” and “I need to be able to access each department in my business from the software”
  2. Communication/translation of vision to UI/UX and development team 
    * embedding of PO in development team/ active PO role in team
  3. Importance of iterative requirements refinement
  4. Champion PO role on dev team via 
    * Driving of UI/UX wireframe/prototype creation 
    * Driving of communication of business value and end user goals to development team 
    * End result: Backlog creation ….transition into next topic
3. Backlog Creation 
  1. Requirements != Backlog
  2. Nothing should be in backlog unless it directly contributes to the goals of a project
  3. Does not need to be “complete”
  4. Iterative refinement
  5. Most current items should be most granular
  6. Epics
    * ... to Stories, to Tasks
4. User Stories
  1. User story workshop 
  2. Value Statement
    * Communicates work to be completed and WHY that work is valuable
  3. Acceptance Criteria
    * Testable outcomes of completion of work
    * Definition of Done?
  4. Manage traceability of requirements and backlog 
5. Story Mapping / Traceability 
Keeping the “big picture” in front of mind while executing
SM - visibility via whiteboard, story mapping, roadmapping, etc ...end goal in end
List exercises/tools for team that PO can own 

Running Example: Customer wants a couch...

###USER STORIES
User Stories make up the Product Backlog. To create value-driven stories that accurately reflect the client’s requirements, think of the acronym DEEP: Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized. To expand on this concept, a User Story should be _Detailed_ enough so that everyone understands the need, including acceptance criteria that define when the User Story is considered “Done.” Without getting into implementation, the detail provided should be sufficient for the Delivery Team to provide an _Estimated_ value of the amount of effort it will take to implement a User Story. (Stories near the top of the Product Backlog can be estimated more accurately than those near the bottom.) The Product Backlog should contain those stories that are considered Emergent—reflecting current, pressing, and/ or realistic needs. And, of course, the Product Backlog should be Prioritized so that everyone under- stands which stories are most important now and require implementation.
Most Agile teams use the concept of User Stories to help define how the work will be accomplished. A User Story is essentially a business need captured and stored in the Product Backlog.

####Strong v. Weak User Stories


| **Strong User Stories Are…** | **Weak User Stories Are…** | 
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| - Developed and prioritized by the Product Owner | - Developed without designating the specific user or user group that will receive value from the story’s |
| - Written from the user’s perspective, implementation and employ user roles | - Created with limited Product Owner involvement |
| - Simple and concise, with clear alignment to business value | - Missing a description of the business value |
| - Entry points to a conversation on how the implementation activities can be decomposed | - Technical specifications which don’t link to the user’s point of view |
| - Written with easy to understand success criteria | - Open-ended with no means to validate acceptance |
