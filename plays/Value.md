###USER STORIES
User Stories make up the Product Backlog. To create value-driven stories that accurately reflect the client’s requirements, think of the acronym DEEP: Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized. To expand on this concept, a User Story should be _Detailed_ enough so that everyone understands the need, including acceptance criteria that define when the User Story is considered “Done.” Without getting into implementation, the detail provided should be sufficient for the Delivery Team to provide an _Estimated_ value of the amount of effort it will take to implement a User Story. (Stories near the top of the Product Backlog can be estimated more accurately than those near the bottom.) The Product Backlog should contain those stories that are considered Emergent—reflecting current, pressing, and/ or realistic needs. And, of course, the Product Backlog should be Prioritized so that everyone under- stands which stories are most important now and require implementation.
Most Agile teams use the concept of User Stories to help define how the work will be accomplished. A User Story is essentially a business need captured and stored in the Product Backlog.

####Strong v. Weak User Stories


| **Strong User Stories Are…** | **Weak User Stories Are…** | 
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| - Developed and prioritized by the Product Owner | - Developed without designating the specific user or user group that will receive value from the story’s |
| - Written from the user’s perspective, implementation and employ user roles | - Created with limited Product Owner involvement |
| - Simple and concise, with clear alignment to business value | - Missing a description of the business value |
| - Entry points to a conversation on how the implementation activities can be decomposed | - Technical specifications which don’t link to the user’s point of view |
| - Written with easy to understand success criteria | - Open-ended with no means to validate acceptance |
