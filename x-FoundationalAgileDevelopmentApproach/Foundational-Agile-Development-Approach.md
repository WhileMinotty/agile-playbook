###FOUNDATIONAL AGILE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

More than 70 percent of the organizations using Agile have adopted Scrum or Scrum variants, as noted from the survey results conducted by VersionOne®. (See Appendix D for additional details.) Agile programs at Booz Allen have also overwhelmingly employed Scrum as the foundational framework for implementing the Agile mindset through a set of proven repeatable results using Agile practices. For this reason, we have used Scrum as the basis for developing Booz Allen’s Agile Development Model and recommended it as a team’s entry point into Agile development, with other Agile frameworks (e.g. Kanban) reserved for more experienced Agile teams.

For newly formed Agile teams, the recommended approach is to integrate Booz Allen’s Agile Development Model with the capabilities offered through our SmartSuite integrated lifecycle management tool set. The iterative nature of Agile and associated processes that comprise the Agile Development Model (see Figure 1) are presented in Booz Allen’s Organizational Standard Process (OSP), which provides a set of standard engineering lifecycle processes for use by systems and software development projects. The OSP is housed in the Process Director (PD) application (Thin Client version) and is accessible online.


###2.1	SCRUM AS A FRAMEWORK
Scrum is an iterative, incremental Agile framework for managing software development projects. Its focus is “a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal” as opposed to a “traditional, sequential approach.”  Our Agile Development Model (See Figure 1) incorporates several Scrum practices that are described later in this playbook. But first, we introduce you to key terminology. Bear in mind that Scrum employs time-boxed events (defined periods of time during which a task must be completed), including Product Backlog Development, Release Planning Meeting, Sprint Planning Meeting, Sprint, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Daily Standup Meetings.

User Stories depict high-level definitions of requirements that address specific functionality of the product and are planned and executed across a series of Sprints (tightly time-boxed events that include repetitive development cycles). The project team uses Burndown Charts to track estimated work versus actual work to ensure development activities execute on schedule. Velocity determines how much Product Backlog effort the team can take on in a given Sprint. Daily Standup Meetings promote team communication and interaction on a regular and consistent basis. These meetings also identify potential blockers or impediments in the workflow, which are then handled outside the Daily Standup Meeting by only the required stakeholders.

Sprints, which generally last about a month, provide a process for the team to design, code, build, test, and then potentially release functioning features of a given product. The process begins with Release Planning, followed by Sprint Planning, and Sprint Execution. Upon conclusion of the Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review to discuss what has been accomplished (demonstration of new features created during the Sprint) and then concludes with a Sprint Retrospective (similar to lessons learned).

It is important to note that, in many cases, the project team may not release the software to system end users after each Sprint, but rather focus on incrementally creating working software for the Product Owner to review and validate against expectations. **Figure 1** on the following page captures the Booz Allen approach to Agile development.

###Key Planning and Implementation Considerations— Agile Development Model
####Artifacts
Our Agile Development Model focuses on creation and use of three main artifacts that help Agile teams monitor progress toward goals defined during Release Planning and may be further defined during Sprint Planning Meetings.
* **Product Backlog** > A prioritized list of product requirements presented as User Stories, updated at least weekly, and ranked and estimated using a scale based on Story Points (see Section 5). This type of backlog serves as a high-level view of the work that must be completed to create the product.
* **Sprint Backlog** > A detailed list of all tasks from the Product Backlog that must be completed based on the User Stories assigned to a given Sprint, updated daily, modified through the Sprint process, and classified as “Done” in accordance with the team’s definition.
* **Sprint Burndown** > A graphical representation of the amount of Sprint Backlog work remaining in a Sprint created by summing the backlog estimates for each day of the Sprint.

####Elements

When executing the Agile Development Model, certain elements help define the approach Agile teams can integrate into their project lifecycle (see Figure 1 on the previous page). These include development of the Product Backlog before planning the Release, planning the Sprint and creating the Sprint Backlog, executing the Sprint, performing Sprint Reviews and Sprint Retrospectives, and conducting Daily Standup Meetings. Elements of the Sprint execution cycle include design, code, build, and test.
